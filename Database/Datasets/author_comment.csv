Óscar Sánchez,2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Red Dead Redemption 2 is something we've never seen before on PC, it's really a next-generation game that makes us think about what's still to be achieved in the world of video games. It is currently the most 'beautiful' work at a graphic level that we can find, because there is nothing that looks better in a high-performance team. Rockstar has managed to achieve a graphic quality ahead of its time with this RDR 2.‎"
Álvaro Alonso,2021-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"‎A great expansion, loaded with content and with the level of quality, playable variety and sense of humor that we would expect from a story DLC for GTA V, only weighed down by being within GTA Online.‎"
Aarsal Masoodi,2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades has perfected several elements of the rogue-like genre and does a banging job on the rest. It is, by far, the best game of its type that I’ve played. But don’t let the words “rogue-like” scare you off – it is made in such a way that it is appealing to both fans and non-fans of the genre alike.

Hades is a game I firmly believe anyone even remotely interested should play. I guarantee that you won’t regret your time in The Underworld."
Abdul Saad,2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,"All in all, there isn't much else to say about the God of War PC port. The game runs better than on any other platform and is decked out with all the settings imaginable with bonus content to boot. Replaying through the grand adventure that is Kratos and Atreus' story was also a delight. So if you're a hardcore fan of God of War like I am or have never played the game, then I implore you to do so on PC if possible as its so far the most optimal way to play it."
Abdul Saad,2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,Hades is a fantastic game and is really worth all the acclaim and praise its received thus far. The game's amazing ability to both engage and challenge you is worthy of applaud and the now that the game is available on all platforms many more players will be able to enjoy this spectacular title.
Adam Cook,2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Once upon a time people would overuse the word ""epic"", but it's a phrase truly befitting of Rockstar's brilliant Red Dead Redemption 2."
Ahmet Özçilingir,2019-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Great game, spectacular, unique and incredible atmosphere"
Alan Murilo Pereira Duque,2022-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is one of the best games of all time, and one of the few that I would rate as essential for any gamer. The impeccable PC adaptation makes this the definitive version of this modern classic and the perfect appetizer for a certain Ragnarök that is approaching this year. Unmissable."
Alberto Lloret,2015-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"‎If you are one of those who did not play it on PS3, you have before you a unique adventure of its kind, of those that without words says it all. And if you have it, thanks to the Cross-Buy you can enjoy it on PS4 without costs and with visual improvements. The remasters like that, YES.‎"
Alejandro Alcolea Huertos,2019-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC expands what we saw on consoles a year ago. It brings new content for the campaign in the form of new weapons and missions, as well as a very entertaining photo mode. Technically it's superb and the mouse+keyboard control fits like a glove."
Alessandro Barbosa,2015-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,"Pulling on emotional strings throughout, Journey is every bit the masterpiece on PS4 that it was on PS3. It's an emphatic example of art, sound and design working in complete harmony together, creating a piece of digital art that just begs to be experienced. Journey is nearly flawless, and will remain so until the end of time."
Amirmehdi Namjoo,2019-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"After about 4 years, The Witcher 3 is still a great RPG game. The amount of content in this game is simply huge. This amount of content, along with deep gameplay mechanics, astounding visual art and dulcet music coupled with epic tracks make this game fantastic. The Switch port is a technical achievement for the developers and also looks good if you want to play in handheld mode, but it has some notable differences with other platforms that especially make the game, not the best option. If you need the portability of Switch for this game, then don’t hesitate and buy it, but for playing this on a TV or monitor, I suggest going with other platforms"
Andrea Maiellano,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Eleven months after its official release, Hades finally arrives on the consoles of Microsoft and Sony confirming itself as a small masterpiece able to address a much wider audience than you might think considering the genre of belonging."
Andrew Thornton,2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades remains an absolute must-play modern masterpiece on the Xbox Series X. I’m thrilled to see new ports bring it to a new audience. With a wonderful story, memorable characters, some of the best voice acting around, a stunning soundtrack, variety that keeps things fresh even after dozens of runs, incredibly tight gameplay, and game design, which will allow even those who don’t usually care for roguelites to engage with it, this is a game that every player should try."
Arne Cito,2019-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Deep gameplay at an unseen fidelity and attention to detail cement Red Dead Redemption 2 as Rockstar's newest genre-defining adventure. In spite of technical issues at launch, the PC version reigns supreme as the decisive way to experience the Wild West epic at uncapped framerates, obscene resolutions and incredible visuals."
Bahram Bigharaz,2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Into its 3rd generation and GTA V is still printing money for Rockstar. The new generation version is not as jaw-dropping as it was almost a decade ago, but it is the best way to play it if you are one of the very few who hasn't already; And even if you did, the current discounted price might tempt you to give it another try anyway."
Basil Frank,2021-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The more I speak about this game, the more I just want to jump back in for another run. It's addictive, it's frustrating, it's fun and it's highly recommended."
Ben Dutka,2015-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,"Anyway, Journey on PlayStation 4 is undoubtedly the definitive edition of an instant classic. It's not drastically different and there really isn't any new content, but the upgrades included in this package are noticeable and appreciated, and vault the production into the stratosphere. We are moved and impacted; some even say they're forever changed after finishing."
Ben Skipper,2015-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,One of the greatest video games ever made. A masterpiece.
Ben Walker,2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"In a world where developers who design experiences for console and try throw them on the PC, Rockstar Games beautifully takes its time in creating a port that both serves the artistic purposes of the original while allowing players to run free in their best open world to date. Just make sure your PC is up to standard."
Bogdan Robert,2022-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,"After more than 55 hours spent playing, I'm still awed by just how great God of War is. This is the result of a clear, determined vision, its separate elements harmonizing almost perfectly to deliver an experience that understands the series' blood-soaked origins but is also not afraid to push it into a more mature and nuanced direction."
Brandon Adams,2019-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"When everything clicks, Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC is a solid port, just not a perfect one. Largely carried by the fantastic quality of the game itself, the port does at least provide prettier visuals, additional content, and a fantastic new Photo Mode."
Branislav Kohút,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"RDR 2 is a great game, it's actually two in one (you'll pay for it). In the package you will get a massive story and a separate online world full of possibilities. However, the PC version still has some technical problems after the first big patch."
Cade Onder,2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions of Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online are good, this isn't a bad game, it's just not as impressive as one may hope. It has some flashy new graphical effects, a menu redesign, and the 60FPS mode is remarkable, but it's all marginal. For newcomers with little to no experience with the game, this is going to be an absolute treat. For veterans, this may ring a bit hollow. It's worth picking up if you want to keep up with GTA Online and have the best possible version, but otherwise, there are no enhancements that demand you replay the story once more."
Casey David Muir-Taylor,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades on PS5 has been my favorite way to play, and I’m excited more people will be able to dive into Hell."
Casey Scheld,2019-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey's journey to the PC is a successful one, barring some minor technical issues. Between its incredible atmosphere and unique mechanics, this is one title worth exploring."
"Cassie Peterson,Ron Burke",2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,"It's somewhat unfair to compare the next-gen console versions to a PC as my video card costs more than both consoles combined. That said, what Rockstar has pulled off here is as close to a PC running at max settings, but with a slightly lower draw distance and less feature-rich anti-aliasing. On the other hand, if you are coming from the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One, the difference is staggering. Most of the time a next-gen native version of a game is just a higher-resolution minimal-effort wallet hug, but here it's clear that the developers are looking to deliver the best version of their most successful game ever, ahead of finally getting another proper installment in the series."
Chandler Wood,2015-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey is minimalist to allow you to fill in those gaps with your own emotion and experience — to apply your personal situation and make the story your own. It's a simple beauty, but one that shines brightly and now has the opportunity to be played by millions more thanks to its stunning upgrade to PS4, with beautiful lighting and environments that impress. Whether you've played Journey before, or never had the opportunity, do yourself a favor and make your way to the top of the mountain on PS4. You may find more on the way to the peak than you expected at the outset."
Charles Hartford,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"So if you came into this wondering if the Hades port is worth a second look, I could not recommend it enough. The charm, character, and challenging gameplay that made it an instant hit last year gives it more than enough appeal to warrant a second go."
Chase Ferrin,2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is not only a fun game itself, but runs flawlessly on PC and with some really nice visual and performance upgrades that make it now the definitive way to play."
Chris O'Connor,2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Be an outlaw or try and turn over a new leaf in the old west, yes please!"
Chris Shive,2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,Grand Theft Auto V is one the best games released in the last decade and holds up surprising well nine years later.
Chris White,2022-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,"GTA V on PS5 is the best version of the game. The 60fps make it feel smoother to play, with faster load times being a welcomed improvement."
Christopher Teuton,2019-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC remains both a visual and storytelling masterpiece.
Cody Gravelle,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades remains one of the best roguelikes in recent memory regardless of what machine is housing it. As always, the advice ultimately remains the same for those on the fence about the Supergiant Games spin on mythology: go play Hades. Now there's even more ways to do so."
Cody Medellin,2022-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,"If you've somehow held out on getting Grand Theft Auto V until now and don't play games on your PC, then the PS5 version is the one to get. The faster loading times and graphical bumps still make this a good-looking game, despite the age of the assets."
Cole Watson,2019-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The PC release of Red Dead Redemption 2 is without a doubt visually breathtaking to behold, but a wide range of issues at launch sour the experience of revisiting Rockstar's captivating Western."
Cosmin Vasile,2021-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,Review code provided by the publisher.
Dakoda Barker,2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,"A beautiful, emotional, minimalist journey full of wonder and heartbreak."
Dalton Cooper,2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The next-gen version of Grand Theft Auto 5 is a new way to play one of the best games ever made, but the upgrades may not be worth it for everyone."
Dan Hastings,2018-04-17T04:00:00.000Z,"A highly unusual and relaxing adventure that manages to tell the story of a journey without using a single word. The game is stunning and has a very unique visual style to it. The gameplay is simple, yet adequate for the style of game. It is a short experience that is unique and really stands out of other games in a similar genre. The lack of a narrative may turn some people off, but if you can deal with this, it is a game worth playing."
Dani Maddox,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is a lore heavy game with a seemingly endless supply of pickups, quests, and side dialogue centered around Norse mythology and the relationship between a father, Kratos, and his young son Atreus."
Daniel Hollis,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"As expected, Hades knocks it out of the park, offering a stellar experience to Xbox players for the first time. It's every bit as incredible as it was a year ago, with punchy combat, an addictive gameplay loop and a cast of characters that prove to be charming and terrifying in the same breath. It's a shame a few frame rate issues sour the experience occasionally, but make no mistake, Hades is absolutely worth your time whether you're a fan of the genre or not."
Daniel Villagrasa,2022-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,‎GTA V on Xbox Series X gives very little reason for Xbox One players to make the jump (pay-per-use). A version that could well have been free is left behind a payment barrier to justify technical improvements that they know little.‎
Daniele Di Egidio,2019-11-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Getting lost in a game has never been so easy, the universe of rdr2 is boundless and timeless. A joy for the eyes and the heart.
Every gamer in the world should play with it."
Daniele Dolce,2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"After almost ten years, Grand Theft Auto V begins to show its age. It's a remarkable video game though, but three new visual modes can't hide the fact that some of its game systems are beginning to feel antiquated. Still, this next-gen version is obviously the best way to play GTA 5 and GTA Online."
David Carcasole,2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,"God Of War on PC is unsurprisingly the same amazing game it was on PS4 back in 2018, although its pain points are more blatant years later. The visuals, narrative and stunning experience however do not disappoint and remain as impactful as they've always been. It also helps that this is so far, Sony's best port to PC in terms of optimization. This is well worth picking up, whether or not it is your first time."
David Fialho,2019-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"To everyones surprise, the Nintendo Switch can run The Witcher 3, with a great package full of content for those who seek the adventures of a witcher on-the-go."
Denny Connolly,2019-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,Red Dead Redemption 2 is back with a PC port that allows users to explore some new content and push their settings to the max.
Diego Perez,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Whether you're revisiting the frozen Norse realm or diving into Kratos and Atreus' journey for the first time, there's never been a better way to experience this epic tale."
Diego Perez,2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Grand Theft Auto V was a landmark title when it was released, but its online counterpart has surpassed it in every way. This next-gen port is a great way to experience GTA Online, but the lack of single-player additions is disappointing."
Dominic Sheard,2015-05-04T04:00:00.000Z,"At the end of the day, this is still Grand Theft Auto V, an entry that I find is the best in the series, and a game that has been made that little bit better with the performance boost and graphical enhancements."
Dymox,2017-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,Grand Theft Auto V is a great game to anyone who enjoys a vast and expansive open world with lots of stuff do and having something for everyone.
Eden Penketh,2019-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece. No other game has ever tried and succeeded to capture a sense of a time and place long gone while also blending social commentary so well. The addition of a multiplayer mode that's a real step up from Rockstar's last effort makes Red Dead Redemption 2 unmissable on PC.
Emin Çıtak,2015-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Is this just a game? I can feel this game, I can feel this journey in my heart. Great art design and an unforgettable experience."
Eren Eroğlu,2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is one of the best rogue-like games ever; with great music, stylish art design and smooth gameplay."
Erica Mura,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Whether you are a lover of the original series or new gods of war, it does not matter: give it a chance, you will hardly regret it."
Erik Kain,2015-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,"Firing up Journey on PS4 is a delight. It's so gorgeous and fluid in 1080p and 60 frames-per-second. Even though that's really the only thing different about it, it's a wonderful experience."
Eser Güven,2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,Sony nailed this PC port. God of War is climbing the Master Race mountains to bring the PC pantheon to its knees.
Ewan Paterson,2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"It's still a great way to play Grand Theft Auto 5, but even with the visual improvements and new multiplayer content, it feels less like a necessary return, and more like an aimless jaunt."
Filipe Mesquita,2021-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is a sublime experience and certainly deserving of all the praise it has received over the past year. 
With gameplay so juicy that we can only describe as addictive, with one of the most appealing visual and sonic aspects you can find, and with such a well-written narrative, we have no doubt that Hades is one of the best games currently available for PlayStation 5, and most likely the best roguelike produced to date."
Frank Reese,2020-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption 2 feels like Rockstar has turned a corner, but it might not be the corner fans were hoping they would turn."
Gabriel Fuentes,2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Grand Theft Auto V is a very curious case, a game that is still in the main rankings of the world as one of the best-selling titles despite having come out almost a decade ago (and having been given away by Epic), which leads to think that people have bought it on several different platforms and, in many cases, more than once. So, is it worth buying it again? I think that answer depends on each one, on their level of fanaticism for the game, on the economy of each one and on what they expect from production in this new generation.‎"
Gareth Chadwick,2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The core game’s design is showing its age at this point. Many missions are fun activities sandwiched between needlessly lengthy driving sessions. Seriously, the number of times if makes you drive between Sandy Shores and the main city of Los Santos is ridiculous, or having to follow a plane for a full ten minutes for no real reason before getting to board it. It would feel like padding if this wasn’t already a long game without them. In spite of this, the story and characters can carry you through the rougher parts so you can enjoy the heists and the witty arguments along the way."
Geoffrey Tim,2019-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"There's not much in the way of new content, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is undoubtedly best played on PC. With scalable graphics options for future PC tech, improved input latency and an already burgeoning modding scene, Red Dead Redemption will continue to shine on the platform for years."
Giannis Archontidis,2022-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,Grand Theft Auto V Expanded & Enhanced Edition has plenty of visual additions to make players who have played it again have a much better experience.
Greg Wheeler,2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The fact that God of War still holds up after its release in 2018 speaks volumes about the great work Santa Monica Studio have done with this “not really a reboot but not really a sequel” game. When it dropped on Playstation as an exclusive, it rightly received critical and fan acclaim the world over. Fast forward to 2022 and that same experience is now available to PC users, in a port that’s just as good – if not better – than its Playstation counterpart."
Hannah Douglass,2015-07-27T04:00:00.000Z,"A tremendous title on PS3, Journey is even better on PS4 thanks to a better resolution, improved frame rate, and sharper textures."
Hubert Sosnowski,2022-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Do you know what I’m going to do after writing this review? Play Hades again - for fun. It’s just so damn good. Maybe I’ll be able to escape hell, maybe not, but I’ll be happy to try again."
Jack Yarwood,2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,The game is a spellbinding experience that really is a credit to its medium.
Jacob Hegarty,2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall, God of War on PC has improved over the PS4 release. With the added graphical fidelity and the addition of widescreen, ray tracing, and DLSS support, PC players now get to experience one of the best titles from the PS4 in even higher definition and better framerates"
Jake Arias,2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is a hack-and-slash dungeon crawler roguelite with a simplistic gameplay loop, some complex perk combinations reminiscent of Transistor, and a reactive story that sees characters react to just about anything that you do. The problem is that all of the things that you can do are limited to picking perks and killing things in the same four floors of the same dungeon, and the story drags its heels in such an egregious way that you have to finish this same 20-40-minute dungeon something like 50 times to reach the actual ending."
Jakub Smolak,2022-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is a tailor-made game, so that everyone likes it and that everyone can find a lot of fun in it."
James Bentley,2022-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War manages to solidify itself as a wonderful standalone game that rises to the challenge set by its previous games and moves it into a more grounded and, ultimately, fulfilling area. While some may miss the over-the-top action and more distanced camera angle, it makes up for it with one of the very best narrative experiences of the last decade."
James Davenport,2019-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption 2's stark, slow depiction of America's fading frontier is a monumental work straining against stubborn mission design and stability problems."
James Ide,2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,"While picking this up may not be worth it for those who own the PS5 version, for those who played it on PS4 the PC port is a visual feast, it offers significant improvements over this already legendry title and the definitive way to play God of War."
James Ide,2022-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Grand Theft Auto V for Xbox Series X and PS5 isn't so much expanded but it's certainly enhanced. The common criticism here is that it looks the same, and there’s a small nugget of truth to that, the updated visuals aren't mindblowing, but they do add up to make a difference. While those graphical changes aren’t as dramatic as the difference between GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2, the drastically reduced loading times, higher framerates and improved audio on the current hardware does make the game much more enjoyable."
Jason Moth,2022-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"The PC port of God of War takes an already amazing game and makes it look and play better than ever before. Provided you have a rig powerful enough to take advantage of all the new upgrades. But even without all the bells and whistles, God of War remains a modern masterpiece and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot."
Jason Torfin,2015-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,"A masterfully-crafted, scarf-swaddled allegory. Take the trip."
Javad Mohseni,2021-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades takes the usually not well recieved Roguelike genre to a whole another level by pushing the potentials of the genre out of the window, presenting a high tempo gameplay with well-balanced difficulty, eye catching visuals and solid voice acting."
Jed Pressgrove,2015-07-24T04:00:00.000Z,"Its anecdotes function as mawkish indicators of social status, as the Internet crowd often forgets that being online is a privilege for more than a few."
Jim Sterling,2015-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,This is interactive art. This is how it's done.
John Cantees,2022-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Despite some slight performance issues, God of War not only lands on PC well but also proves to be a much more natural fit for the platform than any other PS4 exclusive so far."
Jonathan Gordon,2015-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,"A prettier, smoother version of a classic"
Jordan Baranowski,2019-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC is truly mesmerizing.  This is the definitive way to play Rockstar's Wild West epic.
Jordan Middler,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Even if you’ve played God Of War on the PS4, it’s more than worth going back for another trip up the mountain."
Jorge Loureiro,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,The PC version of God of War goes to show that it remains one of the best action and adventure games. There is no equal.
Joseph Siemsen,2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption 2 breaks the rules of the games I tend to enjoy. Lower on my preference list are both life simulators and open world, yet I found myself thoroughly engrossed in what was offered."
Joshua Wright,2015-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Ultimately you will get everything you expected from GTA 5 for PC; a tremendous game with many months of playability and the potential to only get better. If you own a kick-ass PC you should buy it. If not, take the $1500 you were going to spend on that poseur Mac, and buy yourself a kick-ass PC."
Juan García,2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Red Dead Redemption 2 will be the first game in the series available for PC. It includes several graphical and technical improvements to offer a more immersive experience, as well as new bounty hunter missions, assaults on lairs and weapons, among other things. Red Dead Redemption 2 for PC also allows free access to the multiplayer world of Red Dead Online, which includes all the improvements we have been implementing and the latest content updates. That way, you can enjoy the full online experience, including the trades of the West and the specialized roles of bounty hunter, dealer and collector, in which you can progress to exclusive rewards.‎"
Juan García,2015-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"‎A beautiful journey, unparalleled in the history of the video game.‎"
Juraj Malíček,2015-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Journey is, it is the perfect game – of course, if we respect that is the definition that defines the game as a form of execution."
Keith Milburn,2015-08-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey's beauty isn't solely from its art or music, or the experiences crafted by its level designers and programmers. It's the way all of the elements speak to each other, and how it challenges classical game systems to further reinforce its metaphors. Journey was a masterclass in emotional design when it came out. This sharper, crisper version still carries that badge."
Kevin VanOrd,2015-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey has only improved with time, earning its status as one of the best games ever created."
Khari Taylor,2022-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,"With a plethora of visual enhancements and quality of life improvements for GTA V and GTA Online leading the charge (60fps performance, ray-traced shadows and significantly faster loading times chief among them), there’s never been a better, easier or more affordable time to visit San Andreas on current-gen consoles, whether it’s your first trip or if you’ve been away for years."
Krzysztof Mysiak,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"If you always wanted to play God of War, but never owned a PS, this is the perfect moment to try this legend on PC. The port is solid, and technical shortcomings aren't serious enough to prevent you from having fun with this phenomenal slasher. If you know GoW from PS4, you probably want to ignore this release – there's nothing new compared to the original."
Kyle Simcox,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is the best Rogue-like on the market. It's only downside is it's genre which will scare away the more casual gamer. Aside from that, everything about Hades is absolutely fantastic."
Lexuzze Tablante,2015-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Grand Theft Auto V showcases the masterpiece of an open world action adventure title that Watch_Dogs and other open world games have failed to deliver. The mind-blowing graphics, alluring gameplay experience, and the perfect online mode makes Grand Theft Auto V a deserving game to be awarded with Game of the Year title of 2015!"
Lillian King,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"If you don’t own any PlayStation consoles and this is your first chance to play God of War, then this is your call to action. It’s worth it: there’s a reason everyone was obsessed with this game. God of War lives up to the hype, and it hasn’t aged since its release. All the reasons God of War was so good the first time around haven’t gone anywhere."
Logan Moore,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"At the end of the day, God of War on PC is, well, God of War on PC. That might sound like a trite way to describe this port, but the fact that I found no major drawbacks or issues with this version of the game is basically all that you can hope for when publishers bring a console game to PC. The end product here shows that PlayStation is becoming much more experienced with this PC porting process, which isn't just a great thing for God of War, but it bodes well for the company's future plans in this space. If you somehow haven't played God of War already, now is the time to rectify that mistake and prepare for the arrival of Ragnarok later in 2022."
Lorenzo Quadrini,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"All in all, this PC version is a jewel within an even greater jewel which is God of War. The four years of waiting are therefore more than justified and, above all, do not weigh in the slightest on the game's performance. God of War has not aged, it has even improved and contributes to the already huge pool of games for PC users. Through a fine porting work, and thanks to the bases of excellence, we speak of a video game that should not be missing in the libraries of any fan."
Lou Sytsma,2019-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,"This is unquestionably a brilliant experience. Everything about this version is bigger and better than the console version providing you have the rig to run it on.

"
Luuc ten Velde,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is even better than it was in 2018 thanks to the power of the PC. With an uncapped framerate, native 4K and Ultra-Wide Screen support the game looks amazing and plays even better. If you're new to the series, this is the place to start."
Mahdi Maleki,2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Console version of Hades is just a masterpiece as well as PC version. Actually, i can say that Hades is the perfect meaning of a ""roguelike action dungeon crawler"". Don't miss this game at all."
Marc-Antoine Bergeron Cote,2022-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The PC version of God of War meets the main criteria for a successful port with compatibility with the latest technologies, the use of the peripheral of our choice or the possibility of increasing our immersion with ultra-wide screens in 21: 9. During my test, I did not have any particular technical problem or bug strictly speaking. If, according to the developers, this version of the game offers true 4K resolution, there are still textures that are a little blurrier than the others. Nothing too bad and it does not spoil the experience at all. The most positive point of the PC port of this adventure with Kratos is the fluidity that the latter possesses by allowing the user to completely unlock the frame rate."
Martin Černický,2019-12-05T00:00:00.000Z,"ed Dead Redemption 2 is a true colossus with an unbelievable attention to detail, who qualities shine through despite the technical shortcomings of the PC version. One of the most memorable titles of the last few years definitely deserves your attention, even if you'll find out it's not your kind of game in the end."
Martin Černický,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,God of War is an excellent entry in the iconic series that is accessible even without playing the original games and still feels fresh four years after its initial release.
Marty Sliva,2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,"Three years later, Journey remains one of the most powerful games in recent memory."
Mateusz Gołąb,2015-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"The most beautiful experience of the past generation, now also available to PS4 owners. If you haven't lived your Journey yet, make up for it. If you are already after, then it is worth refreshing. Just like the Little Prince."
Matt Lorrigan,2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is an excellent action game that allows players to find progression even in death. Roguelikes are normally known for their high level of difficulty, but in Hades, the greatest challenge you’ll face is trying to put it down."
Matt Purslow,2020-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"At campaign level you’ll be playing as three distinctly different characters in an astonishingly detailed and accurate recreation of Los Angeles, engaging in missions that tips hats to the best in crime cinema. A GTA world has never been as populated with things to do, be that hurling yourself out of helicopters whilst riding an ATV, or seeking out bounty hunt targets for big cash rewards. Los Santos is a world full of amusement and excitement, although these days Rockstar’s satire is starting to wear a little thin and the jokes don’t always hit the right mark. Online, it’s the same experience, but all the other gangsters are real people. And you can engage in a car chase with a rival player whilst Kenny Loggins’ Danger Zone plays on the radio. If that doesn’t convince you, I don’t know what will."
Matt Whittaker,2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,"With the addition of Journey, the PlayStation 4 library has gotten a heck of a lot more special. If October's Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection manages to avoid being a technical disaster, this will mean that Sony's latest console will have five of the most incredible PlayStation 3 titles available for purchase if you include both this and The Last of Us Remastered."
Maurice Pogue,2015-05-24T04:00:00.000Z,"GTAV is a masterpiece, successfully reproducing the awe that we felt when GTAIII first hit the streets while also surpassing GTA: San Andraes in both volume quality of content. Content concerns are without number, though gamers should expect nothing less from a franchise named after a felony."
Mohammad Talebian,2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,"What seemed impossible a few years back is now a reality and PC gamers can finally play one of the most important Sony exclusives of all time thanks to recent developments in video games industry; and even though it has been 4 years since the initial release of God of War on PS4, it's still one of the best action adventure games currently available."
Morgan Davies,2015-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,"One of the only complaints this game has experienced from countless players is its length. If you're familiar with the controls, you could easily complete the game in just over an hour"
Muhammad Ali Bari,2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Weak endgame aside, Hades is an innovative and refreshing take on the roguelike genre, coupled with fast, frenetic, and fun gameplay."
Myles Gann,2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,New Sony adopters can hail as an indie champion has come to PlayStation 4 while returning Nomads can appreciate the upgraded visual splendor.
Natalie Lindner,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War’s PC port is a must-have for fans of games with seamless combat and gorgeous graphics. Kratos’ story and character development as a father and mourning husband presents players with a heartbreakingly beautiful tale accompanied by vivid depictions of Norse mythology. Its visuals create immersive arenas to battle the living and the undead in over 40 hours of story gameplay. Whether fans are experiencing God of War for the first time or are weathered veterans of the franchise, nearly everyone can enjoy God of War’s PC port."
Neil Bolt,2015-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Whether you played and enjoyed Journey before or are curious to see what the fuss is all about, the PS4 version provides a great excuse to experience one of PSN's greatest titles for a first or second time."
Olly Smith,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is a narrative gem. What it lacks in pacing and agency, it more than triumphs in writing, acting, and directing. What it results in is a deeply emotive story about a familial relationships and the ties that bind us. With a sequel just around the corner, now is the perfect time to get into this series. As part of Sony’s directive to bring more of its beloved franchises to PC, I’m glad it settled on one of the PS4’s most popular titles."
P-A Knutsson,2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,Intense and challenging battles are mixed with amazing characters that populate colorful and lovingly created environments. The tribute words hail and Hades is worth every single one – although we would have liked to have seen more improvements and news alongside the one-year-old Switch version.
Paolo Besser,2019-11-08T00:00:00.000Z," Red Dead Redemption 2 was fantastic on PlayStation 4, and it remains fantastic even on PC, with the addition of some aspects that were missing in the original edition."
Paulo Roberto Montanaro,2022-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Without any content additions for those who have already explored every alley in Los Santos, this version of GTA V may not be enough for veterans, but it remains a true masterpiece in the new generation. It also supports 60 fps or the ultra-high definition in 4k, making it the best possible way to enjoy this great criminal journey."
Paweł Musiolik,2015-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Still a great production. Not everyone will like it, but that does not mean that it is not worth the attention. An additional plus for the fact that having a PS3 version, we get a release on PS4 for free."
Peter Dragula,2022-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,Rockstar releases GTA V for another generation of consoles. Now with small graphic upgrades and with 60 fps mode. But it's not enough for paying upgrade.
Peter Paras,2015-08-02T04:00:00.000Z,"At the end of the campaign, you'll most likely be surprised to find that the one person who hung out with you was really three, or four, or more. What's more surprising was that seeing all the people I'd come into contact with hits me emotionally. I don't know them, but I 'know' them."
Peter Taylor,2022-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War showcases what can be done when time is taken with the periphery as well as the main story. By taking the time to weave the strong foundation that is the Norse Mythology with that of the Kratos' history with Greek Mythology, Santa Monica Studio have crafted a truly intriguing world to inhabit. ‍"
Phil Hornshaw,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War isn't drastically different on PC when compared to the PS4 version that launched back in 2018, but its little improvements are definitely nice ones, making this a solid PC port overall. There isn't reason enough here to buy a second copy of the game if you've already played, necessarily, but the PC version is a great reason to check out God of War for the first time for anybody who hasn't had a chance to experience it. God of War remains an excellent, gorgeous, affecting action game, and with the port to PC, it gets a handful of nice, if somewhat minor, improvements."
PJ O'Reilly,2020-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,Red Dead Redemption 2 is Rockstar's greatest achievement to date – an epic Western masterpiece set in a phenomenally-detailed recreation of 1890's America. Top-notch acting across the board brings its beautifully-written cast of characters to life and the riveting central story is surrounded on all sides by an almost endless array of deep and satisfying side activities that serve to further ground you in the life and times of Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang. A must-have title for your Xbox One.
Ralph Beentjes,2022-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,"With the next-gen version Rockstar has brought us the ultimate version of Grand Theft Auto 5. The graphics have been improved a lot, the loading times are much faster and the PS5-version even has a couple of features for the DualSense controller. The question, however, is whether you want to replay the same adventure again, as there is no new content, nor any improvements or additions to the gameplay. A version purely made for newcomers or true fans of GTA 5."
Randy Kalista,2015-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey is masterful. It's meaningful. You won't remember the details of every journey, but every journey is unforgettable. You'll have no choice but to play it again and again."
Reid McCarter,2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Needless to say, the 2013 release of Rockstar North’s Grand Theft Auto V generated a great deal of excitement."
Richard Bouvier,2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey is a unique, exhilarating and inspiring experience. I have been playing video games for over 30 years. In that time games have matured into a narrative medium capable of making you laugh, to cry, to fear to hate and maybe most impressive of all to mourn and to love. The medium when used effectively can inspire great emotion and spur great philosophical debate. Through active immersion games can easily enchant you in ways traditional passive media simply can’t. In a wonderful and impactful game such as Journey those memories and those experiences will haunt you long after the credits roll."
Rob Larkin,2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Action roguelikes is a genre seeing a bit of a surge of new entires lately, and Hades is as good or better as anything you will find in that field. It offers an overall experience in storytelling and gameplay that is top-notch regardless of genre. It's this incredibly unique type of game and play loop that turns your every failure and death into a reward of unlocking more story, injecting more humor, and inviting you to take a stab at one more run. It's won numerous game of the year awards on PC, and there is no reason for those accolades to stop with the port to consoles. Just don't forget to give Cerebus a pet on your way to the next run."
Rob Pitt,2021-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"I have to agree, Hades deserved every single award and critically acclaimed review it received, it’s one of the best roguelike games I’ve played on PlayStation. The visuals, voice acting, music, and gameplay all work perfectly together, creating a very polished, addictive, and challenging, yet rewarding experience which you’ll instantly become hooked on and find hard to put down. The game does suffer from a lack of variety when you’re playing in long sessions, but that’s because the game is beautifully hand-crafted rather than procedurally generated, so it’s to be expected. If you’re not mesmerised by the satisfying combat, strategically planning your upgrades and boon pick-ups, or wiping your sweaty palms after an intense boss fight, you’ll be fully engaged with the brilliant narrative and interesting NPC interactions."
Robert Yatco,2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a really great PC Port. While there may not be any new post-launch content here, it's just a prettier version of an already excellent game. For those who haven't played this game and have the PC specs to run it well, God of War for the PC is a must-play!"
Rubén Rionegro,2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead redemption 2 is the same console game but even better. This new version comes with a lot of exclusive content and very juicy improvements like playing at 60fps, new accessories for the campaign mode, an improved photo mode or the possibility to use mods. Unfortunately the optimization is not as good as we would like and we will have to wait for a patch that solves it. Apart from that, this is a real masterpiece and one of the best games ever. It would be a total irresponsibility not to play it."
Rubén Rionegro,2019-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Journey is one of the best games-experience ever created, if not the best. Its capacity to transmit so many emotions and feelings has rarely been seen so effectively and forcefully. It is, however, a prerequisite to open your mind and understand that video games can go beyond mere entertainment, sometimes focusing on simply provoking an emotional reaction."
Sam Comrie,2022-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Ultimate it's going to come down to how much you love the Grand Theft Auto franchise, as Rockstar's next-gen upgrade is purely aesthetic and performance-based. Just like it was in 2013, it's Grand Theft Auto 5."
Sam White,2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"PC is the best place to play last year's best game. It's massive yet detailed, sprawling and epic, and combines Rockstar's penchant for immense detail with a surprising amount of human heart.Sam White"
Sammy Barker,2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"GTA 5 is beginning to show its age, but it's a testament to Rockstar's original vision that Los Santos still stacks up. The improvements to image quality and framerate give this sunny sandbox a new lease of life, and while some of the single player gags may not hit as hard as they did in 2013, there are still plenty of memorable missions across the release's 30 or so hour running-time. Meanwhile, GTA Online's freeroaming multiplayer lobbies remain unmatched, and while newcomers may find the learning curve borderline impenetrable, if you can overcome its idiosyncrasies there's nothing quite like the crime caper on offer here."
Sandy Kirchner-Wilson,2021-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt is an amazing triumph of fantasy world design. It successfully pairs fast action gameplay with slower methodical planning and preparation moments, as well as having an incredibly fun main storyline with plentiful side quests. At this point the game has been out for a long time, but it is highly recommended that it is on anyone's lists especially if they missed the boat on the original release. In a word, fantastic."
Sarah LeBoeuf,2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"In Hades, you'll die a lot, but this compelling roguelike makes battling out of the underworld a pleasure."
Scott Ellison II,2022-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is nothing short of brilliant, beautiful, and brutal. From its incredible story to the combat, this is a one camera masterpiece start-to-finish. While it is priced at $50, is several years old, this is PlayStation 4’s best game now available on a personal computer. Made for players old and new alike, God of War is a fresh start for Kratos and the series, and is totally enthralling. God of War is one of the finest games ever made, and the PC version elevates it to incredible heights."
Sean  Cahill,2019-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,"A gorgeous world with so much to explore awaits everyone. It's not without some faults, and those with older spec'd PCs may have trouble running this. If you've got the rig to handle it, it's a wonderful experience."
Sebastián Domínguez,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Supergiant Games has very little to prove with Hades in its console version, beyond its performance and optimization. It's not just that he's been nominated for game of the year. It is that this game already managed to massively captivate critics and audiences alike in 2020. If we can add anything, I'd say that Hades evolves in every way every time you play it, both playable and narratively. From what we can highlight the combat, which is the core of the game, is highly satisfying. This is a game you should at least try.‎"
Seongho Moon,2021-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"You’re going to equip various weapons and receive endless blessings from other Gods while doing your best to escape hell, guarded by your father, Hades. The difficulty hike is no joke and tutorials that kicks you right into middle of hell (literally) would be the first obstacle for those who’re new to rogue-like action genre, but once you get your grip and get used to its mechanics, you’ll be willing to melt away your time like an unattended ice cream left out in the depth of hell. While many rogue-like games suffer from meaningless retries and lack of reward rebalancing, Hades rewards those who keep trying by providing you with more questions and stories to uncover. There are plenty of hardcore modes for the heart of steel gamers who’d like some neverending challenge as well. Fans of hack & slash must try this game out."
Sherri L. Smith,2021-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption 2 serves up complex themes and characters, a heart-achingly beautiful world that looks like an actual western."
Shubhankar Parijat,2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Grand Theft Auto 5's new-gen upgrade is solid and effective, but much too conservative, especially for a game that's long overstayed its welcome."
Stefan L,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"God of War is a great port of one of the PlayStation 4's biggest games. PC gamers have all of the graphics options they could really want, and the game's origins mean that even fairly modest gaming PCs can push for high frame rates and resolutions. If you've not already played the game on PlayStation, this is a great chance to catch up ahead of Ragnarok's highly anticipated release."
Steve Farrelly,2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is a rare breed of game. Supergiant’s design confidence is almost reflected in the cavalier attitude of the game’s protagonist, Zagreus; capable and arrogant, young and vibrant. But evermore charming as a result. I’ve used the phrase before, but this is absolutely a franchise-in-waiting, and more, if the studio and Private Division were so inclined. But know this, at the very least: those accolades? The ones that kept coming? We’re adding to them -- a year on, and now with a new audience and new homes, Hades is still near-perfect and an absolute must-play. Don’t miss the bus again."
Steven Wong,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Although Red Dead Redemption 2 for the PC has plenty of technical quirks, they're easy to overlook once you're immersed in the story and the breathtaking beauty of the world."
Stuart Andrews,2015-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,"GTA 5 can be depraved, amoral, sickeningly violent and childishly desperate to shock, yet it's also one of the richest and deepest games ever made, with an ambitious three-stranded storyline that holds so many disparate parts together."
Stuart Andrews,2020-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is the new RPG by which all other RPGs should be judged. Not only has CD Projekt Red deliverered the largest and most convincing fantasy open-world we’ve ever seen, but a storyline, quests and systems that make it an incredibly compelling place to run, ride and sail around in.

"
Terrence Johnson,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"If you are a fan of rogue-lites there is absolutely no reason for you to not be playing Hades, and if you aren’t a fan of the genre but enjoy action RPG’s with the above ingredients then you should give this a try. If Hades becomes the gold standard for rogue-lites going forward, then consider me a willing convert and long live the rogue lites!"
Theo Weber,2021-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is a near-perfect Roguelike. The game looks great, plays smoothly, and offers tons of variation. There is no boredom in this game that lets you escape, die and repeat over and over again. You just want to reach the end and after that, you want to do it again and again. There are a few minor details that could have been better, but it doesn't get much better than this."
Thom Compton,2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,"Journey is a masterpiece, one that still holds up well years after it came out. It's indicative of the industry that there still doesn't feel like there's anything else like it. Many could call it the original walking simulator, but in reality, it was a game that proved that what we perceive as a game or not may be wildly wrong. It's hard to find an experience that can make being wrong so enjoyable."
Toby Andersen,2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Hades is the new standard by which we measure roguelites. A stunningly modern narrative scenario told in bitesize morsels perfectly designed around roguelites, it also manages to have infinitely replayable combat full of constantly changing moves and powers. It demands your skill and a lot of your time, but it rewards you by providing meaning to the grind."
Toby Berger,2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Even though it's not the 'Expanded and Enhanced' version we were hoping for, Grand Theft Auto V on current-gen is the best way to play the game on console. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles showcase their finest traits, improving load times drastically while adding minor technical improvements that make the experience that much better."
Tom Olson,2017-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,"I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today."
Tony Polanco,2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption 2 impresses on PC with exciting action and stunning, photo-realistic graphics. As with its console counterparts, this is one of the must-own games of the generation."
Travis Bruno,2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,Hades’ ability to blend its narrative with its addictive gameplay makes for an incredibly enjoyable game that can entice even those who have never tried the genre.
محسن وزیری,2016-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,Do not deprive yourself of this unrepeatable experience.
"Uros ""Vader"" Pavlovic",2015-08-14T04:00:00.000Z,"At the risk of getting a bit too philosophical about this, Journey really is just about the journey itself, not about explanations and hard facts. The game just tosses you into a lovely dream-like experience. This experience you probably won't forget."
Vahid Zohrabi Nejad,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"With so many videogames that are totally forgotten a few weeks after their release, it's great to have a title like Hades which has been among the best games of every year since 2018 when it first came out in early access and the home console version continues this winning streak."
Ville Polvela,2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"""Steel and silver."""
Will Borger,2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Red Dead Redemption's PC port isn't perfect, but it's playable now. Its flaws are more apparent a year later, and it never should have launched in the state that it did, but this is still a great game... provided you can run it."
Will Silberman,2022-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Either way, there are multiple reasons to praise the next-gen version of GTA V and GTA Online, but be warned that the new player experience is still much to be desired compared to other MMOs. If you own a PS5, you should definitely take advantage of trying out GTA Online before it becomes a premium game in a few months."
Wojciech Gruszczyk,2022-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,"GTA 5 is back and although it is the ""best release for consoles"", it will rather interest a few. Have you played? You know exactly what to expect. Is it worth it for 60 frames and faster loading? It all depends on whether you've already played Grand Theft Auto 5."

Darryl Edge,2019-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3 is still an astounding game to be celebrated, but even if it's one of the console's considerably better ports, the Nintendo Switch version really isn't the way to experience Wild Hunt."
Garland Pan,2019-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"As a landmark title that other games have trouble matching even now, The Witcher 3 flourishes on the Nintendo Switch. With an immense amount of absolutely engaging content, a meaningful narrative, and a meticulously designed world to explore, there’s no doubt about the quality of the game."
Aaron Potter,2019-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,"It’s easy to see how players would prefer the convenience of undertaking Geralt’s journey on the go, either from the very beginning or as someone who missed out on Hearts of Stone or Blood and Wine and are craving a way to jump in right away. Switcher 3 is the ultimate fantasy RPG and the ultimate in convenience."
Tom Olson,2017-10-25T04:00:00.000Z,"To put it simply, The Witcher 3 is a piece of modern gaming’s history and is a masterpiece that every RPG fan will need to experience if they haven’t already."
Alan Stock,2016-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"The finest RPG in many years, with a vast open world that truly feels alive. Highly polished in every area and stuffed full of quality content, this game sets a new benchmark for the genre."
Eddie Stubbington,2016-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,Loads of Content to Explore with a Beautiful Open World
Wyzzlex,2016-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is easily one of the best role playing games ever made. The world and characters are designed with incredible detail and the story will drag you into an amazing and unforgetable journey. You just need to play it.
Tim McDonald,2015-11-04T05:00:00.000Z,"I've made it pretty clear that it's hardly a flawless game, but that doesn't change the fact that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is something pretty bloody special and you should absolutely play it."
Isaac López,2015-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,"I have put more than a hundred hours just playing this game, and not only I don't feel like I've wasted my time, but I invite you to do it too."
Elijah Beahm,2015-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an amazing single-player action-RPG buried in a mediocre open world game. As much as everyone was wowed by the jump to open world with the third Witcher game, I seriously wish they'd stuck to the formula in their previous games. Sometimes bigger really isn't better."
Erik Kain,2015-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,"All told, I give the game a Buy in my Buy/Hold/Sell ranking. For all its flaws—and I realize that I've listed many—it is one of the most sprawling, magnificent solo RPGs ever made. It does too little to fix its mechanical problems, and focuses too much on creating an open world, but the quality of its quest design, world-building, and wonderful (if too large) cast of characters makes it a game that no RPG fan should miss.

It may be a flawed masterpiece, but it's a masterpiece nonetheless."
Eric Van Allen,2015-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ends Geralt's tale in spectacular fashion, finding ways to fill a giant world with thrilling combat, beautiful sights, and a bevy of compelling content. A strong conclusion to The Witcher trilogy, and a masterpiece that will keep you enthralled for weeks and months to come."
Dominic Sheard,2015-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is more than just an incredible game that successfully brings lush visuals, tactical combat and a captivating world untainted with the issues that games of similar nature have when building such huge open spaces. It is also a respectful closure for Geralt, the series and its fans. Not only is the world a phenomenal character, but the narrative, the fleshed out side content and the character building weaved into this adventure are all purely excellent. With the consequences of morality playing a big part in the outcome of Geralt's adventure, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt sets a new bar for video game writing, and will have players sharing tales of their adventure – in one of the best role-playing games released – for many months to come."
Maurice Pogue,2015-06-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Why are you reading this review instead of playing this masterpiece ? Tsk, at this rate, you'll never beat it! Witcher 3 is the kind of game that we will be speaking of fondly alongside the likes of FFVII, FFT, and Baldur's Gate 2."

Gabriele Aroni,2015-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"All The Witcher fans will love it, but The Witcher 3 is a must-have for any RPG fans out there."
Andrew Barker,2015-06-13T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3 presents a realistic, engaging, and dark fantasy world. With fast-paced combat, deep character customisation, and massive locations to explore, it's a game not to be missed."
Brendan Griffiths,2015-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,"While the decidedly average combat and alarming number of technical gremlins are disappointing for a title that's been in development for so long, The Witcher III: Wild Hunt is still a must-buy title for genre fans. The Northern Kingdoms is vast and beautiful setting, packed with unique adventures and touching tales that you'll find away from the beats of the main story. A title to truly lose yourself in."
Rishi Alwani,2015-06-11T04:00:00.000Z,"With an abundance of things to do, great combat, engrossing narrative, and a fantastic world to discover, The Witcher 3 is the video game equivalent to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It's seemingly never-ending and always appetising - without the nasty side-effects that come with overeating. Quite possibly the best game we've played this year and the benchmark for everything else that follows."
Luciano Howard,2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,"You'll not want it to end, just like you didn't want your very favourite RPGs of years-past to end either. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt will sit in that list now. There isn't any higher praise."
Chris Breault,2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,"Comparison to The Witcher 3 would embarrass almost any RPG. It excels at everything most games suck at, from comic timing to narrative follow-through. It has the most expressive faces, the best drunken banter, the funniest throwaway gags, the most casual sex, and the deftest camera movements. But its best trick is to mold narrative from the materials that games have lately used as a sort of flavorless stuffing. In almost every side-quest and monster-hunting contract you undertake, there are telltale signs of someone at CD Projekt Red actually giving a s***."
Eric Layman,2015-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an exhibition of lessons learned not only from CD Projeckt RED's past work, but also from a spectrum of open-world and role-playing contemporaries. It's expected for games of this nature to excel at taking your time away. What's most impressive about The Witcher 3 is that rarely seems to waste it. "
Albert Lichi,2015-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,"In a game where the action mechanics are roughly 65% of the game's core gameplay, it is important to get these basic parts right and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt tragically fumbles. Good controls are the foundation of a quality game and anyone expecting good action here would be best to just put this white wolf out of his misery and bury him."
Mike Splechta,2015-06-08T04:00:00.000Z,The world and characters come to life in CDPR's conclusion to The Witcher trilogy. A few minor bugs can't ruin what is otherwise a masterful game. If only the combat was slightly better
رضا حاج‌محمدی,2015-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"""Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" meets all expectations and breaks your standards."
Tim Reid,2015-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3 is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red, with a huge world to explore, seemingly endless hand-crafted quests and a central story that holds the experience together marvelously."
Hayden Dingman,2015-06-05T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witcher 3 is probably the best open-world RPG ever made, but it still falls prey to some of the genre's worst traps."
Artura Dawn,2022-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,"A charming precision platformer with a pleasant story about mental health. Gorgeous graphics, beautiful music, and fantastic platforming had me coming back for more despite my thousand deaths."
Frank Reese,2019-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,"A new entry but also one of the best platformers of all time. Celeste is special, it presents hard challenges, great story, but also has the ability for anyone to beat it. Definitely worth playing."
Matt Gerardi,2019-01-15T05:00:00.000Z,"Even without embracing that duality, Celeste would be an exceptionally well-made platformer worthy of sitting alongside its titanic peers, but by caring to find the right amount of warmth to balance its barbs, it ends up standing up and taking a step ahead.

"
Gabriel Carli,2018-12-30T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste gets absolutely everything right. It has surprising audiovisuals, innovative gameplay and an inspiring story. Breaking the fourth wall constantly, it deals with current topics and makes the player embark on a beautiful rollercoaster of feelings, therefore being so immersive. It's indispensable to any player."
Josh Speer,2018-12-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Frankly, I should have bought Celeste a long time ago, but I’m glad I finally made my way the mountain. It’s a perfect example of why I love both indies and platformers. It’s also easily the best platformer I’ve played this year. For $19.99 you get a robust package full of challenge, heart and mystery. This small cast of characters really charmed me, and the gameplay itself was pitch perfect. Though I played it with the default settings, you can turn on many helpful features to make things a bit easier. I had gotten about 1300 deaths and 81 strawberries the first time I beat the game, and since starting this review I’ve already added plenty more to both tallies. I honestly love this indie gem, and can’t recommend it highly enough. Go do yourself a favor and climb this mountain!"

A.J. Maciejewski,2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,"As most indie-keen gamers already know, Celeste is a phenomenal 2D platformer."
LJ Lowery,2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is the complete package with well crafted gameplay, a unique presentation, and a touching story—one of the best games of 2018"
Ian Howarth,2018-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,"Even from an objective standpoint, I honestly can't think of a part of Celeste I didn't like."
Allen Reynolds,2018-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,Celeste blends old gameplay ideas with progressive story telling and the results are nothing short of amazing.
Khurram Imtiaz,2018-04-18T04:00:00.000Z,"A poignant tale that tackles a sensitive subject matter. Celeste is not only a challenging platformer, it is also an emotionally powerful story about dealing with the struggles of mental illness."
Ben Skipper,2018-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is an beautiful, optimistic game about how triumph can outweigh any number of failures . It's about reconciling your pain, frustrations and defeats. It's about getting better, in every sense."
David Sanchez,2018-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is one of the most entertaining 2D platformers in recent years. It'll defeat you from time to time, but its inviting controls, level design, and presentation will keep you coming back until you persevere and overcome every challenge thrown your way."
Josh Hinke,2018-02-26T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste has a couple of hiccups in its aesthetics and tech, but the core of what Matt Thorson and his team have made contains a wonderful story of endurance and resilience for both the characters and the player, that begs not to be missed."
Chris Davis,2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,"I’m not sure I’ll ever truly finish Celeste. I still have a couple of B-Sides to complete and the C-Sides are likely beyond my skill level. Assist mode is there if I need it, but I’m not ready to admit defeat yet. Neither am I ready for Celeste to be over. I’ll be dipping back into this masterpiece for many months to come."
Ali Ghorbani,2018-02-25T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste provides a deep adventure in the heart of a mysterious mountain. It's brightest moments are not of its platforming elements but the interactivity with its other aspects. Overcoming any challenges along the way affects the story one way or the other and as we get close to the end, the final picture tells the story of a strange and excellent adventure. To sum it all up, Celeste is the proof that simplicity encourages beauty"
Afshin Piroozi,2018-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is by all means a perfect game. Perfect level design, great story and enjoyable mechanisms all make this game a must have experience."
Ben Dye,2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,An incredible game; one you're unlikely to forget thanks to its heavy hitting tones and the absolute resolve of its protagonist who never gives in to the temptation of apathy and despair.
Heath Shusterman-Zimmerman,2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,Gamers who enjoy a difficult but rewarding platforming experience should definitely check Celeste out.
Brodie Gibbons,2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste not only joins a long list of phenomenal platforming royalty, but it stands as a mighty pillar among the very best of them. Its message is clear albeit clumsy, though that doesn't detract from its very real and relatable cast of flawed characters. It's challenging in ways many games aren't while managing to maintain an endless supply of magic."
رهوان الفاضل,2018-02-11T05:00:00.000Z,Celeste is a balanced blend of a thrilling story and super fun gameplay that easily have you lose track of time. A jewel not easily found in Platformers nowadays.
Alejandro Alcolea,2018-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is a game that lends itself to an easy joke. It is simply heavenly. The level design is fantastic, artistically breathtaking and playable. It is difficult, a lot, especially after the next lap, but tremendously satisfying. Explain why '' indie '' exists."
Aureliano Carvajal,2018-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is probably the greatest surprise in 2018 so far. Its marvelous platforming, great mechanics, lovely visuals and lovely soundtrack simply make this a must have for anyone who loves 2D platformers."
Seth Hay,2018-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Celeste a fantastic platformer that’ll test your precision and problem-solving skills. Each chapter challenges you to win, die, and have fun. Clearly a game to own in your digital gaming library. The only addition the game could possibly add would be adjusting the control buttons — luckily that is in the works.

You’ll perish hundreds of times and that’s okay! When you’ve figured out how to maneuver around death traps, you’ll be smiling right up until you die again. When that happens, pick yourself back up and try again. I guarantee you’ll smile again.
 
This is it, Madeline. Just breathe. You can do this."
Sam Quirke,2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,"Fans of tricky platformers will find much to love in the game's design, but it's also a perfect starting point for anyone new to the genre — perhaps even those actively averse to it. In short, it's a bit of a masterpiece."
Ben Reeves,2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,A solid story and rewarding platforming sequences makes for a highly gratifying climb
Ravi Sinha,2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,"In an industry with so many passionate titles, Celeste stands tall as one of the best. Its vision is flawlessly executed with excellent gameplay and presentation from top to bottom."
Zhiqing Wan,2018-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Looking at my death count at the end of the game, it was a little shocking to see that I’d died that many times. But Celeste constantly reassures the player that it’s not something to be ashamed of. Every death is a lesson learned, and with every lesson comes improvement. As long as you don’t give up, there’s always a path to success. Even if you have to fail 2,649 times to see it."
Marco Mottura,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is not only a brilliant platformer, one that will surely entertain you with its unusual difficulty and its astonishing level design. Celeste is a touching story about depression, a metaphor of life and ultimately a video game that will teach you a valuable lesson: never give in, no matter if you're dealing with a Gargantuan montain, a series of seemingly impossible jumps or anxiety. It might not be the next indie apocalypse, but it's still a product that's well worth of your time and money."
Zack Rezac,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,All of these factors blend together to form an instant classic. Celeste is a triumph and offers a staggering amount of content for its asking price.
楚楠,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Obviously, Celeste is a wonderful game, with a strong storyline which you barely can see in platform games. Fantastic level design and puzzle settings keep players a feeling of freshness from the beginning to the end, and the large number of levels makes this game worth the price."
Álvaro Alonso,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"A story about overcoming grief and accepting ourselves under the guise of an impeccable platformer. Celeste is the kind of game that no one, not even those who despise jumping games, should miss."
Ville Kovanen,2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,"""Climb over every obstacle, it's worth it."""
Aaron Riccio,2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,What separates Celeste from masochistic games like The End Is Nigh is that it's not bleak or unyielding.
Hayden Dingman,2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is the best precision platformer in years, but it's also a game about the figurative mountains we all struggle with, and that's what makes it truly special."
Daniel Ziegener,2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,"Celeste is not only an outstanding platformer, but also a soulful adventure full of intimate moments."
Juanma F. Padilla,2020-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"An original approximation of what it would be like to play a tabletop role-playing game on your computer or console, an original plot and the feeling of reading a good book in which you are the protagonist. All that and more is Disco Elysium, a unique game that any fan of the genre should have in their library."
Amirmehdi Namjoo,2020-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is a special role-playing game that promises much deeper and more beautiful story titles in the future by presenting a deep storyline, extraordinary characterization for characters, impressive choices, very different character traits for the main character, all of which are effective and have their proper impact on gameplay."
"Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus",2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,"In my opinion, Disco Elysium is the game of the year for 2019. It shows how you can make creative, engaging, and well-written games entirely using writing and player choice without falling into the simple ""visual novel"" style. It's biting, clever, and witty, and it deserves to take its place among Planescape and Fallout: New Vegas. It's a must-play for any fans of RPGs and a genuine modern classic that will hopefully set the stage for many things to come."
Jake Su,2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z,"A truly outstanding piece of art, Disco Elysium is an RPG that warrants playing over and over again."
Cole Nixon,2019-12-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall , while paying respects to gaming’s founding fathers in familiar yet polished gameplay, Disco Elysium paves its own path. While the controls sometimes feel lacking, it is the narrative heart and aesthetics that truly shine to an exemplary level."

Afshin Piroozi,2019-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is a definition of a unique game. ZA/UM has created a perfectly designed detective RPG game that's like nothing else! perfect character development and customization make Disco Elysium a deep RPG and effect of decisions on story makes every play through a different and unique experience. Disco Elysium is one the 2019's biggest surprises and of course best games,"
Brandon Adams,2019-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is perhaps one of the best role-playing games of all time, and I don't say that lightly. I haven't played a game that has been able to so masterfully flex to my actions as well as ZA/UM's freshman outing. The writing is sharp, the characters genuine, and the choices possess true stakes."
Shannon P. Drake,2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Finally, a roleplaying game where you play a role instead of “press button, make the number go up.”"
Jakub Bjaček,2019-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is an unconventional and innovative isometric RPG, offering unusually complex mechanisms and great literary qualities in the vein of Planescape: Torment and Arcanum. It boasts strong atmosphere and attention to details that are sometimes overlooked by the larger videogame developers."
Preston Dozsa,2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is an RPG where you play as an amnesiac cop investigating a murder. Thanks to its writing and emphasis on freedom, it's unlike any other RPG out there."
Bob Richardson,2019-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is a landmark title in gaming that will hopefully set a new standard for quality game design and writing. Everything offered within feels like a work borne from passion and talent, but that latter part’s what has me worried. I would love for Disco Elysium to somehow plant a flag that boldly proclaims, “Here! THIS is what we need to be doing and THIS is how you do it!” Even if a developer understands the “passion” part of the equation and puts in the time and resources, that doesn’t always mean they have a talent for this caliber of game. This review’s already gone on far too long, but I have to convey the affection I have for the central protagonist and his companion — their chemistry. Despite how much of a screw-up he is, I still love him for all his quirks and failings. And I made him that. Perhaps he’s a reflection of myself in some way since I have finally, for the first time ever, been given the true freedom to create the protagonist I want and not some flawless, altruistic knight who’s come to save the day."
Jason Faulkner,2019-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"If you’re someone who doesn’t “like to read” or wants a lot of action in their games, Disco Elysium might not be the best pick. It does an excellent job of bridging the worlds of literature and gaming, and offers a unique blend on the venerable CRPG formula. 
"
Zhiqing Wan,2019-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is gritty and unapologetic, witty and bleak, and forces you to deal with your darkest demons and self-doubt. And I wouldn’t have it any other way."
Burhanudin Zamri,2019-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is one of the best games I have ever played and is most definitely my favourite 2019 RPG.

If you’re looking for a game that will humour you with an amazing narrative for at least 20 hours, this is the game. For those of you who don’t like reading a lot of text in video games and prefer combat over conversations, I would advise looking elsewhere. Disco Elysium has enough words to fill out at least a few thick books, and it’s worth more than a gloss-over or two."
Zack Webster,2019-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Developer ZA/UM succeeded in making a game where progress isn’t tied to the defeat of, say, four hundred rats in a sewer, but to thoughtfully engaging with the world and characters it has to offer."
Krzysztof Mysiak,2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is a truly magnificent game not just for every RPG lover out there, but for any gamer looking for something more than simple entertainment. Get ready for dozens of hours of intellectual exercise – ZA/UM’s title elevates the entire gaming world, bringing the medium closer to true and meaningful art form."
Sam Chandler,2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,"It’s not very often that a game of this calibre comes along. Disco Elysium is mad with psychedelic energy, unabashedly dramatic, and dangerously well-written."
Chris O'Connor,2019-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco didn't die, but someone did and you have to find out who and whodunnit!"
Adam Vitale,2019-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,A wonderfully written dialogue RPG that defies the preconception of what RPGs can be.
Steven Strom,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is a mercilessly deep RPG, both in terms of its well-written world and the sheer volume of decisions it tracks."
Josh Hinke,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is an experience that other developers will be hurrying to unpack so they can try to steal some of its magic. It's been a long time since a video game story has gotten its hooks into me quite as this one has. Despite some shortcomings, I'll be remembering the characters and moments from this adventure for years to come."
Joe Juba,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The mystery has a satisfying payoff, but the bigger draw is navigating the main character's competing thoughts and weighing what kind of person you want him to be"
Chris Carter,2019-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The heart and soul of Disco Elysium is stumbling through success, which has a certain charm to it. Sometimes that road is bumpy and restricted, but the fluff behind those bumps is at least interesting."
Richard Scott-Jones,2019-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"An utterly original RPG that sets new genre standards for exploration and conversation systems, and a brilliantly written tragicomedy about our inability to release the linchpins of our identity. Even when they hurt us.Richard Scott-Jones"

Leo Faierman,2019-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is an exquisitely-written RPG of external and internal turmoil, political unrest, and self-destruction, packaged into a detective noir."
Víctor Manuel Martínez García,2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"The best RPG in years, Disco Elysium is the kind of game that makes you want more from all the other games --a groundbreaking and absolutely essential masterpiece."
Callum Bowen,2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"I fairly enjoyed Disco Elysium. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a very impressive game in its deep approach to role-playing but I found it extremely text-heavy and with no combat, was for me at times quite mundane. Disco Elysium is a very well written RPG, with deep conversations and an intriguing city that will make you want to make sure you are constantly on top of all things regarding your investigation. Whether that be talking and then re-talking to characters to see if you’ve unlocked some new dialogue to extend the investigation, or whether you’re constantly roaming around Revachol making sure you haven’t missed out on any new areas to look into, I just felt it was a lot of slow grinding and to bridge that with a bit of an un-motivating story, it didn’t keep me wanting to play all the time.  Politics play a huge part in the story and I kind of got the feeling that as we have enough politics in the world right now what with BREXIT, that having it within Disco Elysium it’s got on my nerves a little. I am making Disco Elysium sound like a chore of a game, but I was, for the most part, enjoying it.  Disco Elysium is currently £34.99 on Steam.

I am awarding Disco Elysium a Thumb Culture Silver Award!"
Alessandro Alosi,2019-11-06T00:00:00.000Z," Disco Elysium is a little great masterpiece that, due to slow gameplay and its impressive quantity and quality of dialogues, cannot be appreciated by everyone. Unfortunately for them, of course."
Mark Steighner,2019-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium deserves applause for having a singular vision and generally bringing it to fruition through its art, writing, setting, characters and gameplay mechanics which suggest the heyday of classic isometric RPGs."
Jake Hill,2019-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,"The world is not our own, but the fantasy of it allows the game to dig really deep, and I considered political views I hadn’t had to confront in years."
Chris Brown,2019-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Disco Elysium is one of the most interesting games we've seen in decades in terms of its themes and writing. A conversation heavy investigative RPG that leans very heavily on the genre's pen and paper roots. We've not seen this type of RPG in quite some time, and certainly not one as well executed as this. If you like your RPG's densely worded I think you'll find a lot to like here."
Claudio Cugliandro,2019-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"ZA / UM, authors of Disco Elysium, showed great courage in not pretending to revolutionize a genre, but in dedicating themselves body and soul to overcoming their limits by exploiting their merits."
Sean Colleli,2018-08-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Like Limbo, Inside is short, mechanically addictive and emotionally haunting. It's the perfect addition to the Switch's growing library of now-portable indie hits."
Ville Polvela,2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,"""Visually stunning, forces you to think about things outside the game."""
Jamie Ward,2018-08-13T04:00:00.000Z,"If you loved Limbo then do not hesitate, just grab your Switch and buy Inside. For such a simple game, it is remarkable how much variation there is. Puzzles are expertly thought-out, the atmosphere is top-notch and its crammed full of memorable moments. It’s a stunning but desolate adventure that I urge you to try out. Even though it’s a short experience, it makes you consider what you have just gone through long after completion. It is one of the standout games in the Switch’s ever-growing library."
Ricky da Conceição,2018-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Inside is a technical marvel, and a game seemingly pieced together from the shared dreams of Franz Kafka and George Orwell. It’s a rare game that transcends a genre, and for a game where not a single word is spoken, Inside has plenty on its mind."
Vitor Carvalho,2018-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,"INSIDE brings another 2D platformer with puzzles to the Nintendo Switch catalogue but this is a game that clearly stands out on its own merits, thanks to its marvelous art style that suits it perfectly, to its high quality puzzles and to an overall experience that is challenging and long-lasting enough to be appreciated by all its players."
Evan Rowe,2018-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,"INSIDE is still the same excellent game from 2016, now released on the Switch for convenience, portability, and the potential to reach a whole new audience. It is a must-play experience that feels right at home on Switch."
Kirstie Summers,2018-07-25T04:00:00.000Z,Inside is a side-scroller with creative puzzles punctuated by a thrillingly tangible sense of tension.
Jakub Smolak,2018-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Inside seems to be made for a console like the Switch. Keeping the screen in front of our eyes, we are one hundred percent absorbed in what is happening on it, thanks to which the game is even more addictive and has an even more pronounced effect on emotions."
Francesca Sirtori,2018-07-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Inside does not lose any of its peculiar features in this version, showing the best of the gameplay both on portable console and through the porting on TV. This amazing indie game shows its incredible dystopic narration, which has not lost its brilliance and emotions after two years of its first release."
Andreas Salmen,2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,"With a rich atmosphere, solid puzzles, good platforming, and a story that unravels in your mind as you play Inside is one of indie gaming's best titles. It's short and sweet, and it should be experienced by everyone who loves atmospheric and dystopian narratives."
Filipe Da Silva Barbosa,2018-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,"In 2016, Playdead has delivered a masterpiece of a game to the world. Most accomplished and thrilling than Limbo, Inside can now be enjoyed everywhere on the Nintendo Switch. Basically, it's the same game, which is certainly not a fault. We're now anticipating what will come next from the brilliant minds of the danish studio."
Stephen del Prado,2018-07-15T04:00:00.000Z,"However, for those in a situation like myself who missed its initial launch and are playing indie catch-up, Inside is the type of short but gratifying experience that the Switch is perfect for delivering."
Toby Berger,2018-07-13T04:00:00.000Z,"Playdead's Inside is a masterpiece from beginning to end, and its Switch port is as good as you could hope for. It's another must-play title on Nintendo's hybrid, and is unlike anything I've ever played before."
Leo Stevenson,2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,"INSIDE is an absolutely incredible achievement in art, design and storytelling and comes highly recommended for any Switch ower’s library"
Sean Warhurst,2018-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Even if players only progress as far as 'I don't get it', playing Inside—and stepping outside of that comfort zone—will leave you changed, even if only a little, on the inside."
Dennis Stephens,2018-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,Inside is another amazing game from Playdead and I'll be picking up everything they have to offer in the future.
Andy Hoover,2018-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,Inside is a good game bordering on great.
Jon Mundy,2018-07-05T04:00:00.000Z,"Inside is a grimly beautiful platform-puzzler that, while brief, is packed full of jaw-dropping highlights. While its dark tone won't be for everyone, it's all been executed brilliantly, with gently taxing physics-based conundrums woven into a haunting wordless narrative."
Grady Penna,2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,INSIDE is still a deeply thought-provoking experience with a mystery that begs to be explored and is faithfully ported to the Switch.
Mirco Kämpfer,2018-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,"Enormously atmospheric puzzle adventure with great graphic style, which captivates to the end - even on the Nintendo Switch."
Albert Lichi,2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,It always feels like Playdead could have done a bit more with the gameplay by making it longer and having more complexity to some of the puzzles. Most people will feel completely bewildered when it is all over.
Álvaro Alonso,2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,"It doesn't matter when or where you play INSIDE: it will always be a masterpiece. Switch's portability makes this version one to be taken into account if you've never played it before. And if you love Playdead's game, the ability to play it wherever you want is tempting, to say the least."
Steve Wright,2018-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,"Playdead has greatly improved how it delivers a story, but hasn't moved away from ambiguity. The latter three-quarters of Inside cheapens the otherwise refined package, only saved because the studio is the undisputed master of horrific puzzles. Ending aside, it's definitely worth a look."
Vincent Bystry,2018-06-29T04:00:00.000Z,"While the game is short, the journey is worth it."
Scott Polhemus,2018-06-29T04:00:00.000Z,"There are secrets to be found throughout the journey in order to unlock an alternate ending, so don't be afraid to fight the constant urge to move right toward the end. Sometimes, it's wise to try going left. Every so often you come across a game worthy of adding to the endless argument, “Are video games art?” INSIDE is one such game."
Ryan McCaffrey,2018-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Inside is a 2D puzzle platformer that builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater."
Matt Jordan,2018-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,"INSIDE is a game that requires a player who doesn’t learn as they go along. It is a well-made game from a talented young studio, but save for the final moments has little to wow the player after the first half."
Dave Gardner,2017-10-26T04:00:00.000Z,"There are very few games that will provoke as much thought after you walk away from the adventure. I genuinely found myself asking “What did I just experience?” as the credits rolled. Graphically the game is gorgeous and the controls snappy and intuitive. Inside is a triumph of both storytelling and game design, what it sets out to achieve as a video game it most certainly achieves. My only criticism would be that after completing the game there is no real reason to go back (unless you didn’t get all the Achievements/Trophies) and this is only a negative because I enjoyed the game so much."
Richard Bouvier,2017-10-02T04:00:00.000Z,Do yourself the favor and buy Inside and play it for yourself. As far as indy titles goes it's a masterpiece. It's on the same plateau as Journey for me in that regard. Both games are absolutely phenomenal and both will stick in your head. The only difference is at the end of Journey you'll feel pretty good about the adventure you took and have a good idea about what it all meant. You don't get that with Inside. Instead I have been scratching my head ever since and to this day I still can't piece it all together. All I know is it is one of the most memorable games I've played in the last few years.
Rebecca Stow,2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,"The first thing that strikes you about 2D puzzle platformer INSIDE is its visuals. The eerie dystopian environment and muted colour pallet is unsettling, and immediately haunting. Utilising minimalist white, grey and black tones, INSIDE somehow manages to be both melancholic and powerfully alluring – it’s impossible to look away."
Giulia Garassino,2016-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,"Inside manages to present an entire world, to evoke an entire universe, even without the use of any word, simply by concretizing the space around the protagonist."
Isaac Coleman,2016-11-07T05:00:00.000Z,"In the end, I’ve no doubt INSIDE will end up being one of the most memorable experiences I’ve played this year.  Its puzzles are expertly designed, its presentation staggeringly beautiful.  Personally, I’m not sure its four hours of content are worth the $20 asking price, especially for an ending that leaves you with more questions than answers."
Brian Dumlao,2016-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,"Inside shows that Playdead has a knack for the short but powerful puzzle-platformer. The puzzles are logical and challenging, while the story is told well without a reliance on the usual things like dialogue and cut scenes. The balance between both creates a game that has a ton of memorable moments, and the flow is smooth enough that you're compelled to keep playing until you reach the thought-provoking ending. With a presentation that adds greatly to the narrative, Inside is well worth your time."
Daniel Ryan,2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,Inside is the kind of game that hooks you within the first minutes with a ‘Show Don’t Tell’ style of storytelling.
Randy Kalista,2016-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,"This is a game that will still be talked about five years from now—even 10 years from now. Inside was pretty much three hours of me shaking my head, clutching my chest, and realizing every few minutes that my mouth was hanging wide open. It’s an analog science-fiction thriller, and so good that it’s impossible to improve upon. It’ll get right inside you."
Dakoda Barker,2016-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,Inside is a masterclass in minimalist design. Enthralling and enjoyable.
Gareth Brading,2020-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"I can definitely see Dreams having a long lifetime, especially if a PS5 version is swiftly released after the new console. Being able to dive in and try out what’s new and exciting in Dream Surfing is always great, as is slowly building up your skills in Dream Shaping. I don’t think I’ll ever to able to create a masterpiece of my own, but I admire Dreams greatly for empowering those people who can."
Alireza Razmjoei,2020-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,Dreams is a reflection of you. A unique platform to make dreams and ideas come to reality and a huge achievement for Media Molecule that made something beyond a game
Henry Buehler,2020-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,Dreams is an incredible experience that's constantly growing and making the effort to include the player.
Alexander Kremer,2020-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"With Dreams, Media Molecule has set itself a monument in the gaming scene. The story is quite manageable in scope, but it offers the perfect insight into what is possible with the editor of Dreams. With a little bit of dedication and creativity, everyone can realize their own game dreams. With all the community features, the great remix functionality and the community jams, I see no reason why Dreams shouldn't last for many years to come. Media Molecule has already confirmed that Dreams will run on the PS5, so I will probably be able to admire my creations and those of many other players in the next generation."
Carri Grant Raffy Abenoja,2020-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"It’s crazy to think that everything you see and hear in Dreams is made from scratch, entirely by the software’s engine. Now imagine if a full-fledged video game dev team actually spends time to make a game here. The possibilities? Limitless."
Sarina Schlosser,2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is not just a game, but a huge collection of great projects, objects and creative ideas. With a wealth of objects and tools, the extensive editor gives you the ability to make your ideas, dreams and visions come true. Whether you're a dream surfer or a dream shaper, you'll get plenty of stuff to let your imagination run wild. I am incredibly curious about how Dreams will develop in the future and which worlds we will explore.

After a bit of patience and getting used to the world, there are no limits to your fun and creativity. An update with support for PSVR is already being planned and Dreams should also be playable on PS5.

Maybe we will be allowed to explore your created world soon."
Lukáš Lindner,2020-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams brings together a set of tools for all creators regardless of their particular discipline. It is also a library of lessons teaching you how to work with these tools. Thanks to thematic jams it motivates you to create and gives you space to share your creations and collaborate with others. This has not been done before and Media Molecule truly deserves the perfect score, because Dreams in not only entertainment - it also gives the opportunity for more entertainment to be created."
Jake Su,2020-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Creating, sharing, helping, and enjoying, Dreams brings an idealistic vision into life that is simply unlike anything seen before in video games."
Jeanette Kanitz,2020-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"With ""Dreams"", Media Molecule has created a true masterpiece among game construction kits, which opens up undreamt-of possibilities for players and proves to be a truly dreamlike experience. In contrast to simplified game kits, the comprehensive editor allows players to cross the boundaries of individual genres and create almost picturesque settings and cinematic game sequences. However, beginners should first invest a little time to become fully familiar with the complex menus and the individual mechanisms of ""Dreams"". Passionate game developers can draw from a wealth of inspiring dreams and can implement comprehensive game projects in cooperation with friends and the community. In ""Dreams"", passionate creative minds find a game construction kit that sets completely new standards and makes virtually anything possible in dream creation."
Raphael Cano Felix,2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,"But that's why we're also hesitant to recommend Dreams to exactly everyone. The novelty's pleasure settles quickly for those who do not have time to mecca with the dream project full time. After a few days, we've seen all the Super Mario clones available. And then we can see that exactly everyone is in production. The ""Beta feeling"" permeates most of what is uploaded. Although creators have mastered the tools much better than at the early access release."
Julio Fuertes,2020-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,"If you really want to unleash all your creativity, get rid of prejudices and arm yourself with time and patience, because the road is not easy. But the reward, the sweet dopamine that will irrigate your neurotransmitters when you see a new “Like” in your dream, well deserves your dedication. Because life is a dream, and dreams are dreams."
Paul James,2020-03-05T00:00:00.000Z,"A playing experience like no other, with Dream Shaping tools that revolutionise the way we need to look at game development. Dreams is something truly special."
محسن وزیری,2020-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,If it's a game that can be suggested to everyone — whether it's a gamer or not — it's Dreams.
Ryan Rodríguez,2020-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,"For a lot of people, this is not a must-have game. For others, Media Molecule new game show us what the PS4 is capable of and also that is possible to create a game that creates games. Dreams show you the basics of the tools and then let the user create its wildest... Dreams."
Tanner Dedmon,2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams seems like a niche game from a first glance, but it's impossible to truly appreciate what it has to offer until you see what it has to offer yourself. It feels like an arcade with unlimited plays for everyone and a museum encompassing every interest all wrapped into one game. Whether you're there to build or just to look around, Dreams isn't a game to miss."
Rubén Rionegro,2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is not just a video game, but it transcends the concept of the game and becomes something that has never been seen before. The opportunities for creation are unlimited and all kinds of users can find their place here. It's not a game for everyone, in fact it's only for a few, but anyone who wants to knock on its doors will find the most welcoming of homes"
Igor Chrzanowski,2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is so good that I miss words. If you dream of creating games, music or animations, you can confidently realize them here. However, if you don't feel like a Dreamer, you'll spend a lot of time playing with other players' dreams anyway."
Fran Soto,2020-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is not a traditional game, but rather constantly changing innovative content creation software for PlayStation 4."
Paul Tamburro,2020-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"There really is nothing else quite like Dreams. Super Mario Maker may make you feel like Nintendo for a few hours, while LittleBigPlanet will let you create a ramshackle platformer or two, but Dreams will grant you the opportunity to create virtually anything you set your mind to. From RPGs to puzzles, to sports games and first-person shooters, this is an endlessly imaginative toy box to open up and play with."
Andreas Salmen,2020-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is a social network, a content platform, and a creative suite all in one. It's probably the hardest game to review, but it is easy to fall in love with it. It is incredibly polished and does exactly what it promised to."
Kinsey Danzis,2020-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"It didn’t matter that I’d never designed a game before, didn’t matter that I’m not much of an artist, didn’t matter that I can only play music and not compose it. From the very beginning, I felt welcomed by Dreams."
Guillermo Navarrete,2020-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,Dreams provides creation tools for a certain type of gamer to create a community that we will surely talk about for years.
A.J. Maciejewski,2020-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is such an astounding creative experience that I highly recommend it to every PS4 owner. Even if you're uncreative and cynical, it's difficult not to appreciate what Dreams and its community of creators have to offer."
Tomáš Kuník,2020-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,Another unique title from Media Molecule boosts your creativity. Developers count on creations of community.
Harold Goldberg,2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"After three games starring the cute, black-eyed burlap doll Sackboy and a mammoth 11 million user-created levels, Media Molecule, the developer behind LittleBigPlanet, yearned to take community-based game making to the next level. It took seven long years, but Dreams is a far more visually wondrous example of the “play, create, share” mantra from the U.K.-based, Sony-owned studio."
Cade Onder,2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreams is not only a technical wonder that is borderline sorcery but it's a revolutionary PS4 exclusive. It's a wholesome space to create, share, and play where people are constantly setting new standards, pushing new limits, and blowing your mind. Media Molecule has made something that should've been impossible work and work very well.Simply put, Dreams makes you believe in the magic of video games."
Paul Jennette,2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"In short, Dreams has been an honor to play. It’s a console-based creative suite unlike any that’s come before it. It has spectacular visual options, user-friendly controls, and literally endless possibilities."
Nathan Misa,2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"An intuitive and ingenious user-friendly game creation engine that truly embodies Media Molecule's mantra of Play, Create, Share."
سندس الخباز,2020-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Imagination is the limit, literally!"
Dustin Spencer,2020-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,Dreams offers plenty of amazing games for those just looking to enjoy someone else's creativity and a powerful suite of tools for creators to show off their skills
Rob Gordon,2020-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,An incredibly ambitious creation tool that holds the potential for near-unlimited experiences - providing its player base keeps up pace.
Gabriel Moss,2020-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,"On one hand, Dreams is a bottomless bag filled with toys, vignettes, and indie games. On the other, Dreams is a must-own for anyone who's ever been curious about game design."
Artura Dawn,2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn truly expresses how videogames nowadays are an art form, if not only through its visuals and storytelling, then certainly through its expertly incorporated combat. A glee-filled experience through and through."
Greg Wheeler,2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"The quality of the worldbuilding, storytelling and gameplay combine to create a cocktail of heady brilliance; Horizon Zero Dawn is the gold standard for how open world games should be made."
Sammy Barker,2021-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Debuts don't get much stronger than Horizon Zero Dawn. Guerrilla Games' latest borrows liberally from a variety of different sources, and yet it leverages these fundamentals to forge an experience that's daringly unique. The main quest tires a little towards the end, and the writing never hits the same highs as The Witcher 3 – but the tactical action stands leagues ahead of what we've come to expect from the genre, and the presentation is quite simply unmatched."
James Wright,2019-07-04T04:00:00.000Z,"Previously we'd have said that Uncharted 4: A Thief's End was unequivocally the greatest game you'd ever see on the PS4. But now, thanks to the extra processing power of PS4 Pro, Horizon Zero Dawn probably edges it. Hell, it even has a fantastic photo mode thrown in just for good measure that can make those breathtaking vistas look all the more impressive."
Gonçalo Nolasco,2018-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is an impressive entry this generation. The PS4's capabilities are pushed to its maximum, accompanied by an excellent writing and game design, Guerrilla Games' newest title shines with its gameplay and worldbuilding, even though there's some fixes to be made, especially on quests and the main story. With a sequel probably coming on the PS5, the IP's future looks promising."
Ovidio Fuentes,2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the most beautiful and dynamic worlds you can currently play in. The merger of the technological and nature is simply incredible. The story doesn’t let you put down your controller. It’s gameplay is fun, diverse and challenging. Great start to a new fantastic franchise."
Leif Rey Bornales,2017-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Overall, Horizon Zero Dawn made me a believer in new and innovative games. It doesn't  mean that a game is new that it cannot be something high-caliber. And Horizon Zero Dawn proved this to me. Playstation and its first-party games have never failed to deliver a blockbuster experience, and Horizon Zero Dawn is up there on that list."
Matthew Stephen Gatchalian,2017-05-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn manages to turn all the good qualities from well-known titles into an enjoyable and finely polished experience. However, it doesn’t provide anything new for those burned out from playing triple-A games."
Joel Gralton,2017-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,Horizon: Zero dawn was an absolute joy to play through and I really hope Guerrilla Games decides to make this their core IP. I want to spend more time in this world even after obtaining the platinum trophy. The core gameplay loop is incredibly addictive. Hopefully a story expansion comes soon just so I can dive back into this world.
David Parker,2017-05-02T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is a triumph with a handful of minor flaws. Exciting combat, an engaging new world to explore, and a likable, confident protagonist combine for a rewarding experience. While I don’t hasten to call this a system seller, I do think that all PS4 owners should give this game a serious look. With such a strong original property, and an exciting fusion of so many quality game elements, it’s clear that Guerrilla Games has a great deal more to offer than reliance on the Killzone series, and I’m excited to see what they’ll be working on next."
Chris Davis,2017-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn hits the trifecta. Incredible combat, story, and characters. It’s also polished and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. I can’t imagine I’ll play it again anytime soon, but the fifty hours I spent with Horizon were some of the best I’ve ever had."
Darius Kubisch,2017-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon: Zero Dawn convinces with a fresh scenario with an interesting story and the fantastically staged battles against machines. In addition, Aloy is a new hero and the bombastic graphics of the Decima engine will enchant you throughout the entire game. Gladly more of it."
Nicholas Catto,2017-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,"Guerilla Games has outdone themselves with Horizon: Zero Dawn. Whether you’re enjoying the lush, vibrant open world setting, or soaking in every moment of the story, you’ll never stop being entertained. The combat is deep and intuitive, even with the minor glitches I encountered. Aloy adds a strong new character to Sonys already deep roster."
Daniel Brennan,2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,Horizon Zero Dawn is nothing short of a masterpiece.
Bryan Clutter,2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that almost every owner of the PlayStation 4 should experience sooner or later. It doesn’t just appeal to roleplaying game fans or action adventure enthusiasts. This is a game that almost everyone can enjoy in some fashion, and it shows with how well the game has been performing since it’s release one month ago. This is an impressive piece of art for both Sony and Guerrilla Games, and we simply cannot wait to see what is coming next."
Mohamed Ashmawy,2017-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a new Benchmark for Sony's Exclusives, we have a new Face for Sony Games which is Aloy, and just Like Nathan Drake and Kratos also Joel and Ellie she is gonna be the new hero for PlayStation Brand, The Game Beautiful Design isn't only the main selling point but the incredible work Guerrilla Studio did with bringing new IP Different than Killzone with great quality is the real surprise"
Justin Oneil,2017-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,Horizon: Zero Dawn is a testament to the hard work and passion of every individual at Guerrilla Games.
Andrew Otton,2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,Horizon Zero Dawn is great game design wrapped up in one of the best AAA packages put out to date.

Horizon Zero Dawn is a brilliant, beautiful and bold action-adventure. With this expansive and ambitious game, Guerrilla finally have a masterpiece to their name, and, in Aloy, a PlayStation legend in the making."
Domenico Musicò,2017-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best open world games of this generation, a really solid experience and a great piece of work from Guerrilla."
Dan Goad,2017-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is one of the best games of this generation. Whilst it borrows elements from other games, it melds them into a seamless experience that sets a new bar for open world games."
Josh Pedroza,2017-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Considering this is Guerrilla Games' first open-world title, I must say I’m impressed with what they gave us. Using the full potential of the Decima engine, Guerilla Games was able to show the true power of the Playstation 4."
Alex Quevedo,2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,"There was a point while playing through Horizon: Zero Dawn where I questioned how much longer I needed to be at social events because, you know, time in Aloy’s shoes. Or, rather, I skipped out on events entirely so I can play the game. Other times, it was that “well, I could do just one more quest…” feeling. Early on, that’s how I knew this game was worth it. It sucks you in for all the right reasons but won’t overly dominate your life like some other games can (I didn’t cancel that many plans, thank you)."
Matthew Finneman,2017-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,"A shining example of how to debut a new IP, Horizon: Zero Dawn comes out swinging and doesn’t let you go until the credits roll. Deep, customizable combat perfectly complements the engaging story."
Alexandra Collinson,2017-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,"All in all Horizon is a fun game, there is loads of content and the story is engaging. However, there is a lack of personality in the side missions as they all follow the same tropes and become slightly boring. The best thing about Horizon is the world in which you play."
Jordan Rees,2017-03-18T04:00:00.000Z,"Putting a few very minor (and no doubt subjective) niggles aside – I’d argue that Horizon is an unreserved triumph, and a watershed moment for this generation of consoles in terms of maturing the medium. As Nathan Drake settles into a potentially permanent retirement, Sony has done well to pass on the baton. Whether or not we see Aloy again (and I have a strong suspicion that we will…) – Horizon is, thankfully, here to stay."
Enrico Pusceddu,2017-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,"We strongly recommend Horizon Zero Dawn to all of our readers. PlayStation4 may be content with this title, which greatly affects the number of previews that it continues to collect with great care and dedication."
Nicholas Ransbottom,2017-03-16T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn isn't without its issues, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable game that belongs in every PS4 owner's library."
Anthony Preece,2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon: Zero Dawn is one of those rare games that actually feels like a AAA title. The level of polish and care that has gone into the game echoes throughout. It's an incredible journey worth undertaking, worth every moment you spend with the game."
Damien Chambers,2017-03-15T04:00:00.000Z,"Every decade or so, a game comes along that sets a new high bar of achievement in the industry. These games stand the test of time and delight audiences for years to come, even if they never receive the sequel they deserve. Horizon: Zero Dawn is one of these games and it has rightly earned its place among the pantheon of some of the greatest games of all time."
Leo Stevenson,2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,"Horizon is a better game than BotW and while maybe not as ‘important,’ Horizon is the game that will have a lasting, personal impression."
Chris Wray,2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,"Horizon Zero Dawn is a pure sign of what can be completed with an exceptionally designed open world. Not only that, it has exceptional characterisation and a sincere story that doesn't shoehorn elements, allowing for the organic growth of characters. This is a game that I can barely find any faults with, except borrowing some elements from other open world games. Even so, it made each and every element its own in one of the best games to date."
Drew Hurley,2017-03-12T05:00:00.000Z,"There are exclusive titles on every console that epitomise the system; titles that are indelibly linked with that hardware through future generations. Adventures like The Last of Us, like Kingdom Hearts, like GoldenEye and Super Mario 64. Horizon: Zero Dawn stands worthily alongside these iconic releases. The story is enthralling, the open world is lush and inviting, the gameplay extremely addictive, and the sheer scale of it all is amazingly vast. Simply put, this is a phenomenal game."
James Wright (Impulsegamer),2017-03-11T05:00:00.000Z,"There’s been much hype surrounding Horizon Zero Dawn and thankfully it has delivered in more ways than one. It boasts a very likeable and interesting protagonist and the story behind Horizon Zero Dawn is one that is filled with mystery and intrigue. Of course, it’s all about the gameplay and Guerrilla should be commended in creating such a fluid and dynamic game as you explore this post-apocalyptic world 1000 years in the future that is filled with different cultures and even history which seems so real. Combat is fun and the missions are diverse and at the end of the day, Horizon Zero Dawn is a title that really raises the benchmark on the PlayStation 4."
Gary Alexander,2017-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,Horizon: Zero Dawn is an excellent robot hunting game. When you’re in the thick of fighting one of its fantastic robotic opponents it feels like one of the best games you’ve played all year.
Chris Button,2022-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is the perfect sequel. It retains the core of what made the original fantastic, with every feature adding tremendously to the experience. Its cleverly revised class system adds near-limitless gameplay variety, which makes each attempt fun – even when you fail abysmally. This game is everything I wanted from the follow-up, and then some."
Jorge S Fernandez,2022-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"In conclusion, while Rogue Legacy 2 is more of a refinement than a revolution, it nonetheless stands out as another must-have Roguelike, which is impressive given the ever-increasing supply of quality titles in the genre. Even if the plate is currently full, this is another tasty dish that is worth savoring when the craving comes calling again."
Drew Leachman,2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a fantastic game. It takes everything I loved about the first game, refines it, adds way more content, and keeps the gameplay just as tight and smooth. It’s a rogue-like that even non-fans of rogue-likes can warm up to. If you played the first game, this is a no-brainer. Even if you haven’t, you’ll have a great time here with a game jam-packed with content. I cannot suggest this one enough."
Eser Güven,2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"This is the prime version of Rogue Legacy series; better, bigger and badder! Impossible not to fall in love with it."
Andrew Thornton,2022-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 offers so many options when it comes to classes, upgrades, and ways to play it that anyone remotely open to the roguelite genre should check it out. I might have asked for a bit more direction in how to approach certain upgrade paths since the volume of choices can be borderline overwhelming, but it’s a minor quibble when everything else about the game is so fantastic. Rogue Legacy 2’s memorable world and overflowing personality will keep you invested until the very end."
Oliver Shellding,2022-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a masterwork in taking something already great and elevating it without getting lost in ambition and abandoning the core interest. It’s Mega Man 2. It’s LeChuck’s Revenge. It’s freaking Super Smash Bros. Melee. This is the way all sequels should be, and I’m ecstatic to finish my review so I can go back and play it again."
Kosta Andreadis,2022-05-16T00:00:00.000Z,"The flip-side to this is a positive, in that Rogue Legacy’s intricate progression and many, many secrets to discover is enough to warrant on and off play for weeks and months. If you’re after a pure rogue-lite experience and something that has the combat depth and platforming challenge to keep you hooked on its loop for an extended period, then Rogue Legacy 2 is a resounding success. Visually, it's a huge leap forward over the original too - with some fantastic animation and responsive 2D action."
Nathan Gibson,2022-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a worthy sequel that improves upon almost every aspect of the original, adding a wide array of new classes, abilities, and content."
John Carson,2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Despite my nitpicks, every new discovery unveiled, skills obtained, and boss defeated wipes away any grief and replaces it with deep satisfaction. There’s a lot to clean up with the core progression systems to make the ramp from beginning to end escalate more evenly, but I’ve enjoyed most of my hours struggling through countless generations of my goofy little bloodline. I am overjoyed the entertaining heritage of this series remains firmly intact."
Mark Steighner,2022-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy essentially spawned the roguelite genre and nine years later, its sequel improves the recipe in every way. Rogue Legacy 2 looks fantastic and plays even better, with engaging mechanics and an addictive gameplay loop. While you might not always make progress, you also never feel bored or that the game disrespects your time. Every run is a new experience and often surprising. There are a lot of systems at play, but they generally help Rogue Legacy 2 transcend the limits of the genre and make it endlessly replayable and entertaining."
Ravi Sinha,2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is an excellent step up from its predecessor, adding tons of new, fun content along with heaps of systems for even more varied runs. Though it can be grindy and somewhat difficult, the enjoyable gameplay will keep you coming back."
A.J. Maciejewski,2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,Rogue Legacy 2 is simply one of the best indie games ever. It manages to stay true to the original while forging its own identity in ways that make it stand out as unique and ultimately superior. You'd be a complete goof if you don't enjoy every second of it.
Ed Acosta,2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 has entangled me in its grind. It has cracked that code in me where others often get it wrong. Thanks to the randomness of the heroes, the ability to carry over progression, and the fun combat, I have that urge to keep playing. Rogue Legacy 2 will easily sit in my top games of this year and possibly be one of the most fun times I’ve had this year."
Győző Baki,2022-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 doesn't revolutionize the saga but expands and improves every part of it, adding great variety and many options for the players. This will keep it a constant presence in your hard drives for many months."
Ivanir Ignacchitti,2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a perfect example of what action roguelikes can offer. With robust gameplay systems and a proposal that does not use procedural generation as a crutch, it is simply a must-see."
Linden Garcia,2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is built to be played for hours at a time or for ten minutes; it’s welcoming to Rouge-like newbies and PC veterans; It’s uncomplicated yet with a suitable amount of depth. Cellar Door Games have undoubtedly outdone themselves again, setting a new bar for the Rogue-lite gameplay style they helped kickstart."
Suhyung Jung,2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy2 shows a perfect combination of Rogue-lite and Metrovania. the game is enjoyable for hundreds of hours thanks to both genres compensate each other's downside.  While, the improved exploring and battle systems added the completeness to the previous title, similar gameplay styles and monster designs can make you feel somewhat dull."
Nick Herber,2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a delightful mix of action-platforming with enough progression elements baked in to keep the many deaths from getting too frustrating. Unlocking new areas of my tower or discovering new traits was enjoyable, as was trying out new class / weapon / ability combinations with each new generation.

Rogue Legacy 2 is a worthy successor to its ancestor."
Aaron Zimmerman,2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"There is a story, told mostly through notes left strewn around the environments, but I’d be lying if I said I paid any attention to it. The draw here is the gameplay loop, and if what I’ve described above sounds tedious to you, the game is absolutely not for you. Rogue Legacy 2 is a game about repeated failure, and only slow, incremental progress will lead to your success."
James Luff,2022-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"While I did manage to find a few things to nitpick there is no denying I kept coming back to this game run after run. The random generation of the character types and level design is so enormous that every attempt at taking down the castle felt different. On top of that, the controls are tight and easy to use and the game is overall enormous fun to play. Rogue Legacy 2 is everything I loved about the original title with so much more added to it. Unless you absolutely hate the rogue-lite genre there is plenty of incentive to jump into the sequel thanks to its accessibility features and general refinements to the gameplay. Even years from now Rogue Legacy 2 is sure to solidify itself as one of the best in the rogue-lite genre. Well at least until the next game that is."
Ryan Gilliam,2022-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2’s extremely random nature would crush a lesser game, but Cellar Door Games uses that pressure to create diamonds. Even if it’s occasionally frustrating, Rogue Legacy 2 refuses to ever let me be bored, and that’s more than enough to set it apart from the heap of roguelites that have followed in the original game’s wake. I’m 30 hours into Rogue Legacy 2, and I’m still discovering new toys to play with. But I still haven’t found another spoon."
Daniel Medina,2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,Rogue Legacy 2 builds upon everything Rogue Legacy established and improves on it in every way. Its addictive gameplay and beautiful world-building are enough to make it one of our favorite games of the year.
Adrián Kemuél,2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 has followed in the footsteps of its predecessor, taken everything that made it great and built a fun and unforgettable experience."
Anne Marie Coyle ,2022-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,A sublime addition to the Rogue Legacy family and one of the best rougelites yet.
Jake Su,2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"A stupendous continuation of the legacy of Cellar Door Games, Rogue Legacy 2 is everything you would want in a sequel, and then some."
Grant Dotter,2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a wonderful, beautiful, crazy-hard-and-yet-not-at-the-same-time game. I can hardly stop playing it long enough to finish writing this review. It is hard to find flaws in this game without resorting to extreme nit-picking. Every aspect of it just oozes polish. The replayability is off the charts, even after you finally reach the ending."
James Cunningham,2022-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is an enormous beast of an adventure, packed with fast combat, great platforming and endless replayability."
Elliot Attard,2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 learns from its lineage and presents a superb sequel with a huge amount of depth of content. With so much replayability and meaningful progression, the game will have players hooked on its delightful gameplay loop for hours upon hours. Built with both style and substance, Rogue Legacy 2 is a tremendous success for fans of the original and the genre. It may not be a game for everyone, but for those willing to take up the challenge, a truly splendid journey awaits."
Kurt Perry,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,Rogue Legacy 2 does everything a sequel should. It builds on what was already well done in its predecessor while reworking any ideas that weren't executed as well. Cellar Door Games has made something both franchise fans and newcomers should be extremely excited to play.
Jason Coles,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a sequel with great genes. The sense of progression constantly pulls your forward, all of the new mechanics and unlocks add a lot more depth and longevity to the game, and the combat and platforming feel just as solid as they did in the first game. It's an excellent roguelite that offers a lot of stuff to do as long as you're willing to put in the time."
Álvaro Alonso,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Cellar Door Games surprise us with a sequel that not only surpasses the original in everything, but also automatically becomes one of the best roguelite ever made. You won't be able to stop playing.‎"
Jordan Devore,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage."
Mitchell Saltzman,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 honors its own legacy as the premiere roguelite thanks to its outstanding assortment of classes, diverse areas, and rewarding combat, putting it shoulder to shoulder among the very best of the genre."
TJ Denzer,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"The original Rogue Legacy was an incredible step forward for rogue-lite games. It helped to establish a lot of cool elements that games after it would mimic in many ways. I wouldn’t say Rogue Legacy 2 reinvents the wheel here. Instead, it polishes that wheel to a sheen, gives it fresh treads, some fancy spinners, and makes it an all-around better version of the wheel we knew and loved. If you loved the first Rogue Legacy, then Rogue Legacy 2 is very likely to capture your heart as well. If you’re jumping into this series for the first time at Rogue Legacy 2, you’re in for one of the most fleshed out, fun, and varied rogue-lite action-platformers that the genre has to offer."
Ainsley Bowden,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is an absolute delight. It’s charming, funny, unique, deep, and incredibly well-designed. Cellar Door Games knew what they had with the original Rogue Legacy and took their time to ensure Rogue Legacy 2’s official 1.0 release was something truly special."
Jesse Norris,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is excellent in every conceivable metric. The gameplay is fast, tight, and feels fair. It’s simplistic but beautiful graphically. The music is excellent, and the story is intriguing but not in the way. At $25 US this is something every fan of the genre either new or old should give a try. It takes every positive from the solid first game and improves upon it while sanding away many of its rough edges."
Christian Harrison,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 is a leap above its predecessor, which was already great fun. The music, characters, and world blend to create one of the most enjoyable Rogue-likes of this decade. The sheer level of content will allow players to engage with this world for hours and hours, and the House Rules enable the player to make it more challenging after that. Rogue Legacy 2 is a must-have for fans of the genre."
Dave McAdam,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Instead, the folks at Cellar Door Games focused on making the best sequel they could for the game that Rogue Legacy is. They have absolutely catered to fans of the original, without leaving new players behind. They have not been intimidated by advancements in the genre of roguelites into making a totally different game, which is especially admirable. The only thing Rogue Legacy 2 wants to be is the most fun version of Rogue Legacy it can be, and it absolutely succeeds in that endeavour."
Alana Dunitz,2022-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Rogue Legacy 2 has taken everything you loved from the first title and improved on everything, this is an incredibly addictive roguelike with customisation options to make it accessible for everyone no matter your skill level!"
Mike Moehnke,2019-02-28T05:00:00.000Z,"I enjoyed my time with Pillars of Eternity and think it provides a good example of the type of RPG not seen much in recent years, but it’s not going to convince those who were never attracted by similarly styled titles in the past."
Luis Sánchez,2015-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity made it clear that Kickstarter can be a valuable tool for developers, as long as they are committed to achieving the best possible quality of their artistic vision. In this case, the product far exceeded our expectations by delivering a wonderful, indomitable and representative experience of the RPG genre. I am eager to know what the future of the franchise will be, especially if there will be a sequel, because I want to reuse the character that I painstakingly built and watched grow."
Rob Larkin,2015-05-22T04:00:00.000Z,"This is the type of game that needs two scores. One for the diehards of the genre and one for the newbies. The development team catered to their core group, and I feel they made the game that they wanted to play. But ultimately I also feel I have to hold them responsible for making a game that feels inaccessible in so many ways. Once you get over the learning cliff, there is a better game out there than this score represents. Pillars of Eternity is like a speakeasy. If you know the dirty, dark alley you need to go down and have the password for the doorman, there is a wonderful, vibrant, and robust world on the other side filled with dancing girls, jazz music, booze, and cigarettes."
Ben Moore,2015-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,"These are small grievances with what is ultimately one of the best games to bear the Obsidian name, which isn't said lightly. Like so many RPGs, Pillars of Eternity is immense with an abundance of things to do. But unlike so many RPGs, it manages to fill its many spaces with craft and care. The towns aren't just towns, the dungeons aren't just dungeons, and the characters aren't just an assembly of stats. Everything takes on a very believable form, transporting players to truly fascinating places. "
Jonathan Gordon,2015-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,A beautiful RPG – Essential PC gaming
Jason Schreier,2015-05-01T04:00:00.000Z,"A well-made, fascinating role-playing game with a lot of heart."
Jodi Mullen,2015-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,Pillars of Eternity takes some of the best aspects of the Infinity Engine RPGs of yesteryear and hammers them into an impressive game that feels slick and intuitive even by modern standards.
Angelina Bonilla,2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity is a fantastic game with a straight forward story and engaging characters, but its problems lie in the fact that it is so determined to root itself in the past."
Stephen Meyerink,2015-04-22T04:00:00.000Z,The best RPG Obsidian has ever made. Just be ready to read.
Nick Wanserski,2015-04-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Still, it's in the smallest moments where Pillars is most fascinating. Stories of dead gods resurrected, of divine plagues and magical obelisks jutting from the earth like broken bones, are the easy stories for fantasy games to tell. It's in the simple stories where they often falter. Pillars Of Eternity deserves credit not just for telling those stories but telling them well."
Jorge S Fernandez,2015-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,Obsidian has set the bar for the genre very high with a game where technical and plot quality is breathed from the first scene. A tremendous tribute to the references of the 90s
Rob Kershaw,2015-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,"In almost every respect Pillars of Eternity is a true successor to the genre - a perfect introduction for RPG newcomers, and for everyone else, the game they've been waiting fifteen years for."
David Jagneaux,2015-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity is an epic that either meets or exceeds all of my lofty expectations. Minutes turned to hours, hours turned to evenings and evenings turned to days as I immersed myself in the wonderful world that Obsidian has created. You must gather your party before venturing forth—a dangerous and exciting world awaits you in Pillars of Eternity."
Chad Sapieha,2015-04-16T04:00:00.000Z,Obsidian's crowd-funded isometric RPG is a dose of splendidly written fun that fondly recalls the pen-and-paper games of our youth
Josh Hawkins,2015-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,"Obsidian Entertainment's return to the age of the Infinity Engine excels with a beautifully crafted story, and an exceptionally diverse and beautiful world. "
Josh Hinke,2015-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,"Even with the bugs, Pillars of Eternity is an RPG that any fan of the genre must play. It keeps the old-school mentality of the genre alive, while also offering something fresh and original."
Zack Reese,2015-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,"While elements such as the writing and level design are on point as always when it comes to the developer, there are a few things that newcomers should be aware of coming into this modern interpretation of a beloved period of time for Western RPG fans."
Aligi Comandini,2015-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Pillars is a great western RPG, a very rich title, with complex gameplay, with this curated, beautifully written dialogue and an impressive care for almost every aspect. However, much of its greatness comes from those who preceded it, those Baldur's Gate and that Planescape Torment that traced the furrow on which Obsidian's last work calmly lingers. It is difficult to criticize the house for the choice made, given the solidity of these classics, but a little more courage we would have appreciated it, especially with a rival like Divinity on the pitch."
Jordan Hurst,2015-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity is a rare game that delivers exactly what it promises, all of which are things that gamers frequently ask for: legitimately mature narrative, deep tactical combat, and a genuine challenge free of artificial difficulty. Obsidian claimed the game would relive a classic era, but it didn't stop there. By casting off the restrictions of its inspirations' Dungeons & Dragons-rooted mechanics (and a lot of standard role-playing tropes with them) and building such an intriguing world, Obsidian has made one of the most refined and original RPGs in years."
,,
Levi van Tine,2015-04-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Obsidian's 'Pillars of Eternity' is a worthy successor to its ancestors and, in some ways, manages to surpass them. In terms of story, this is a worthwhile experience. In terms of content, it is a bargain. It is a strategy RPG for the ages."
Daniel Hallinan,2015-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity is a wondrous return to form, the latest and greatest from a recent move to revisit RPG classics. It's certainly the best RPG experience I've had for many years, and a massive part of that is how it approaches its story telling. If you enjoyed the Infinity engine games, you will have an absolutely fantastic time with Pillars of Eternity. It's a huge reminder of all the things I never knew I sorely missed from the roleplaying genre."
Luke Batt,2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,"Seriously, if you love your role playing games lore heavy, challenging, and fun, you literally can't go wrong with PIllars of Eternity. With the amount of pleasure I've had playing this game, it can easily stand tall and proud as one of the most tactical, thought provoking, and enjoyable RPGs I've ever played."
Carl Batchelor,2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,"With its well fleshed-out world and clever twist on classic Dungeons & Dragons-style rules, Pillars of Eternity could be the next big RPG series that people have been wanting from the genre for the past decade. As for me, I'm already working on a second trip and still gloating over the success of my dwarven Paladin to anyone who will listen."
Kosta Andreadis,2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,"It conjures up a genuine need for this style of RPG -- isometric, hand-drawn, party-driven, stat-heavy, and a whole lot of fun."
Alexander Leach,2015-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,Pillars stands on its own as an immersive world and fun gameplay experience.
Peter Parrish,2015-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,"Obsidian's Pillars of Eternity revisits the company's Black Isle roots, resulting in a High Fantasy, party-based RPG in the traditional style. Strong thematic hooks, well-written characters and reactive quest design, all resting on an original set of tabletop-inspired mechanics, make this a triumphant return."
Toby Hills,2015-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity demonstrates that a great RPG is as much in our own heads and hearts as it is a developer's vision relayed through a monitor. A must-play for fans of the genre, old and new."
Emre Günen,2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,"A production that deserves applause not only as a quality RPG game, but also for its full content and poetic narration."
Chris Breault,2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,"Like Arcanum and Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines before it, Pillars of Eternity is a feat of world-building. Its supporting cast, led by the haunted Grieving Mother and the blowhard priest Durance, is one of the genre's strongest."
Jonathan Edwards,2015-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,"An RPG in which you can easily lose hours, should it grab you."
Kevin VanOrd,2015-04-05T04:00:00.000Z,Pillars of Eternity is a lengthy and enjoyable role-playing game that springs from a time-honored tradition.
Kerwin Tsang,2015-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,"The truth of the matter is that Pillars of Eternity has no significant or crippling faults; it is merely a game so dedicated to its genre and its lore that players who don't know what they're getting themselves into are likely to be blindsided. For players that do know what they're getting themselves into, however, Pillars of Eternity is another triumphant example of the resurgence of no-nonsense, story driven PC RPGs."
Kat Bailey,2015-04-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Pillars of Eternity is more than an appeal to nostalgia; it's a rich RPG in its own right, boasting enjoyable combat, a strong story, and masterfully paced quests. What flaws it has — poor pathfinding A.I. and a Stronghold that feels somewhat derserted — are comparatively minor in the grand scheme of things. Right now, its biggest problem is a surfeit of bugs, which seem endemic to Obsidian's RPGs. Ignoring all that, though, Pillars of Eternity is enormously entertaining, and may end up making a strong claim to being one of the best RPGs of the year."
Tim Steffes,2015-04-02T04:00:00.000Z,"Obsidian's Pillars of Eternity is a love letter to those gamers who remember RPGs of old – when parties were large, adventures were world-sprawling, and you read a book or two worth of words before the world was saved."
Branislav Kohút,2015-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"At the moment, it's unparalleledly the best hero game on the market, and this year there's perhaps only one RPG in sight that could bring down Pillars of Eternity from the imaginary throne."
Robert Grosso,2015-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,"It may seem like I am being too harsh on Pillars of Eternity, but in truth the game is one of the better Kickstarter titles to be released, and gives a lot of independent and even some AAA titles a run for their money."
Jesse Norris,2021-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is an all-time classic. As part of Xbox Game Pass it is one of the easiest recommendations I’ve ever made on this site/channel. It is tough but fair. It finds that perfect balance of teaching you as you fail, and you will find yourself thinking “Just one more run” time and time again as the hours pass by."
Christopher Byrd,2020-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"And as painful as the end of a run can be, “Dead Cells’” steady introduction of new mechanics made it easy for me to pine for one more go. In my view, that’s the hallmark of a successful arcade experience."
Alex McCumbers,2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Even years after the initial release, even after games are starting to cite Dead Cells as their main inspiration, this game is surprisingly good."
Brian Para,2019-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Masterfully crafted pixel-based visuals, replayability galore, and great controls make Dead Cells a must have for fans of the roguevania genre. For everyone else, be prepared for endure countless deaths, but know that you’ll feel like a badass by the end. Docked or on the go, Dead Cells earns itself a solid 4 meows!"
Beau Severson,2019-01-25T05:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is one of the first games I feel has pushed the rogue-like action platformer since Rogue Legacy, a classic in its own right. Definitely find this game on PC or Switch."
Robert Marrujo,2019-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells likely won’t convert any roguelike detractors, but it’s a wildly creative and fun title nonetheless."
Furkan Güler,2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is one of the best rogue-like games in the market right now. Also, it has really good playability.
"
Anders Wollner,2018-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,"This is not only one of the best action game of 2018, it's a modern classic that gives new life to a genre that we thought was starting to fade away.
"
Lucca Cardoso,2018-10-16T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells mixes elements from two different genres that are starting to oversaturate to create its own genre: the roguevania, offering refreshing originality. All of its very well-executed aspects create an experience like no other."
Gonçalo Nolasco,2018-10-04T04:00:00.000Z,"The versatility and flexibility of each run, with its incredible visuals, fluid combat and an extremely satisfying sense of progression make Dead Cells a must play game."
Michal Grác,2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is a unique combination of the roguelike and metroidvania genres, which may discourage players who don't like difficult games, but will satisfy the rest for a long time."
Ryan Pearson,2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells could have been a disaster – another game where your arm is behind your back unless you get lucky. Instead your skill is rewarded, and even when enemies become frustratingly fast, you always get the urge for just one more run. Good luck does help of course. It is not perfect, but it is dead close."
Nick Cooney,2018-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,Dead Cells is an addictive yet brutal game that’ll have you swinging from frustration to enjoyment in quick succession. It’s perfect for when you have a spare couple of minutes jumping in and out for a quick game.
Lucy Wood,2018-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,Dying repeatedly has never felt this good.
LJ Lowery,2018-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells sits in a genre that many strive to find success in. It succeeds where others fail due to a providing a memorable experience. Its rogue nature creates such a variety in gameplay that no two players can tell the same story. The Gothic, medieval setting and mysterious lore make every step taken worth it, as does all the sweet weapons and upgrades."
Álvaro Bustío,2018-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is a highly recommended game, both for short games and long sessions. For dungeons generated procedurally fan´s only.it."
Bob Richardson,2018-09-09T04:00:00.000Z,A lackluster roguelike in a sea of high quality.
Sara Boardman,2018-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Fighting in Dead Cells is an unavoidable showcase of the game. With every different enemy comes their own flair on how they come at you. Some will have shields that deflect, others throw energy bombs. Even the most simplest of baddies toss their entire bodies at you, like a meaty, gelatinous bullet. Every fight requires careful strategy and razor sharp reflexes. Getting hit even once can send you into a spiral of pain that leads to only one place--back to the beginning of the game. It's a brilliant and brutal system, and I would be lying if I said it wasn't utterly addicting."
João Duarte,2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is a unique work that combines metroidvania and roguelike elements, and while that may sound paradoxical at first, Dead Cells found a way to make it work, even if it's not perfect. Thanks to its gameplay cycles, it will be possible to build up a sizeable arsenal while repeating procedurally generated levels with plenty of enjoyment and the game's fluid and fun combat system make this an involving and very entertaining experience."
Arshad Mawla,2018-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,"There are some shortcomings and features that could’ve been better. Despite this, at its core, Dead Cells is one hell of an action game that rewards skill and patience. It’s a game about repetition, but each cycle being better than the last. This is one game you’ll keep coming back to over and over again."
Kosta Andreadis,2018-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,"And when compared to the classics that inspired its design, that's just about the perfect outcome too."
Bryan Clutter,2018-08-25T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is a great new addition to the Metroidvania genre, and it’s amazing that this is Motion Twin’s first major outing besides free-to-play based browser games. Kudos to the team for creating such a memorable experience that sinks it’s claws into you and keeps dragging you back for “just one more run” at 3:00am in the morning."
Richard York,2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,"With a timer and handy teleportation gates strewn about areas, Dead Cells certainly feels a lot faster paced than most of the other rogue-like games I’ve played. Even the combat, with liberal use of the dodge roll, feels a lot more fluid and technical. With a fresh soundtrack that I felt really captured the ambiance of each zone inside the castle, and some pretty dang nostalgia inducing pixel style graphics that aren’t grossly overdone or under-styled, Dead Cells is certainly a game I’d recommend for any fans of the rogue-like genre who are looking for a challenge, especially since there is such a wide array of platforms to choose from."
Jason Hidalgo,2018-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is the perfect representation of a genre that once seemed dead but has come roaring back to life. A Metroidvania-style rogue-life game, Dead Cells boasts excellent mechanics and punishing difficulty that forces you to ""git gud."" It's admittedly on the short side and can be repetitive after a while. A sturdy foundation based on solid core mechanics, however, make this one fun romp that bears repeating."
Drew Leachman,2018-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,"The fun is in the combat without a doubt, and any action fan will have a great time with this one. Even if you don't normally enjoy Rogue-like style game, this is one of those you have to pick up."
Ville Kovanen,2018-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,"""Long live the dead."""
Cosmin Vasile,2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,"If you haven't yet picked up Dead Cells, even if you're not into roguelike platformers, I strongly recommend getting it since it's one of the best of its kind."
Alec Meer,2018-08-20T04:00:00.000Z,"Plunge into ingenious shifting labyrinths to battle lethal beasts, in the knowledge that every gory failure makes you stronger"
David Martin,2018-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"‎They will kill you a thousand times and you will keep trying. Because it is the basis of this game, repetition and learning. All this coupled with a beautiful aesthetic and an epic soundtrack, makes Dead Cells ‎‎a safe bet‎‎ to spend the remainder of summer, and much more.‎"
افشین پیروزی,2018-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,The distance between Dead Cells and a perfect masterpiece is as narrow as a hairstyle.
Ali Rajabi,2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,"If I wanted to describe Dead Cells in one single word, I'd say Infinite. There is no place for repetition in Dead Cells, no ends, this game's aim is to be always funny and worth replaying. Judging by it's price and the content it offers, Dead Cells is easily if not the best, one of the best Indie games that should be placed among nowadays' AAA games."
不倒翁蜀黍,2018-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells looks like a simple old-school 2D platformer, but the core gameplay is modern and smart. The combat is fast, the gameplay style is various, and every time I start a new round would enjoy a different journey. This is a game that could easily cost you hundred of hours."
Hugh Mitchell,2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is an awesome, colourful, action-platformer with a deep customisation system. It's procedurally generated levels will keep you coming back again and again, literally."
Dave  Rodriguez,2018-08-17T04:00:00.000Z,"Super Metroid, Symphony of the Night, and now Dead Cells – it easily stands with the greats in every regard."
Ollie Green,2018-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,"If you like roguelike or Metroidvania games, you'll love Dead Cells. It's unforgiving at times, but the experience remains constantly rewarding and enjoyable."
Nick Ballantyne,2018-08-16T04:00:00.000Z,"Dead Cells is a fantastic melding of two seemingly contradictory design philosophies. A Roguelike at heart, the game utilises Metroidvania levels in a way that gives the player freedom of choice without making any style of play pointless. There’s plenty of opportunities to employ your brain cells in crafting different builds of stats and items, and even with the simplistic combat, the game is a blast to get through. I cannot recommend the game highly enough, and it may very well have cracked a gap through my cynicism for the first time since I saw Yennifer on a unicorn."
Victor Sánchez,2018-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Retro is fashionable, and sometimes it's to be welcomed. If you miss your childhood, this Towerfall Ascension is an excellent choice. Especially if you play it accompanied.‎"

Ozzie Mejia,2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,"With numerous maps, characters, and an engaging single-player mode, TowerFall is a deep experience and one that's worth having in the Switch library when company comes over. TowerFall started off its life as one of the sole shining stars of a doomed Ouya platform, but now it ends its life in front of a massive Nintendo Switch install base. And this star shines as brightly as ever."
Andrew Rockett,2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,TowerFall has always been an all-time great local multiplayer title–that has not changed on Switch.
Neal Ronaghan,2018-09-27T04:00:00.000Z,"TowerFall is best as a competitive local multiplayer game and if you're commonly in the situation of having friends around to shoot some arrows at, it's a must-play. If you're not, it's a harder sell."
Mitch Vogel,2018-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,"Towerfall sets the standard for excellence in local multiplayer, creating a fun and endlessly replayable experience that's sure to be a blast every time you play."
Dan Thompson,2019-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I can't recommend What Remains of Edith Finch enough if anyone has yet to play it. With so many incredible games that are currently coming to Switch, it's important to support the special titles coming from publisher Annapurna Interactive. Its explorations of loss and tragedy left me emotional on numerous occasions, yet it also holds an uplifting and edifying emotional core. This experience remains undiminished thanks to a comprehensive port that doesn't make any drastic sacrifices to the performance and visuals. As far as I'm concerned, it's required reading for those passionate about storytelling in video games."
Lewis White,2019-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch is a 'Walking Simulator' that doesn't just tell an unforgettable story – it's genuinely unforgettable. As tragic as its tale is, it always manages to entertain. As one section ends and as you fight back tears, you'll always carry on, because the next story is as engrossing as the last. If you want a strong feature-length story that doesn't waste a minute, Edith Finch is the one you need."
Joe Devader,2019-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,"With well-acted narration, plenty of variety in terms of gameplay, and a powerful tale that will have you coming back to find any details you might have missed, What Remains of Edith Finch is a must have for any Switch owner who enjoys a captivating story."
Mattia Mariano,2019-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,"What remains of Edith Finch is a masterpiece, even for people who don’t like video games; the great narrative, coupled with a great concept and a perfect sound and graphical aspect, makes the game a great package, only faulting in the difficulty and longevity department."
Luciano Howard,2018-03-12T04:00:00.000Z,"The stories being told are delightful in their own right, fully enveloped in searing atmosphere and wonderfully spine-tingling."
Dan Hastings,2018-01-14T05:00:00.000Z,"The story of the Finch family is not just unique, but it is told so incredibly well that you can't help but get sucked into it. You finish with so many questions you would love to ask the odd people that lived in this unusual house. The game feels a little too short, but every minute of gameplay that is there is an absolute pleasure to experience. What Remains of Edith Finch is a story that really stands out and is one that you will want to experience for yourself."
Kinsey Danzis,2017-08-18T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch knows its niche from the beginning and rarely strays, resulting in a cohesive experience that I was never jolted out of. It elicits the strangest mixture of emotions, and its different modes of storytelling are second to none. The controls don't translate seamlessly from PC to Xbox One, but you don't play this game for the controls; you play for the story, and the story is gripping."
Jen Karner,2017-07-31T04:00:00.000Z,"If you enjoy a story that pulls you in, then this game is definitely one that should be on your wishlist."
Elodie Mellado,2017-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"A courageous, humane and sincere proposal about the relationships we establish with our loved ones, with the spaces we inhabit and, above all, how to learn to live with the inevitable fact of our mortality. In a medium in which killing is the order of the day, where murder has become one more mechanism to advance the plots, to the point of completely trivializing death, never has a video game used language in its favor in such a human way. What Remains of Edith Finch is more than brilliant, it is necessary."
Ben Skipper,2017-07-22T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch is an astonishing patchwork of inventive ideas rich in unforgettable moments. This is interactive storytelling in its truest form. A narrative adventure game that serves as another nail in the coffin of the reductive and derogatory term 'walking simulator', imbued with the ideas of a talented team working at the peak of its powers. This is a game that needs to be played. It's an essential new text in the history of video game storytelling."
Cade Onder,2017-07-20T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch is one of the most creative and brilliant uses of the video game medium despite not being super ""gamey""."
,,
Mark Delaney,2017-07-19T04:00:00.000Z,"In some ways, games are the successor to movies and we've seen plenty of cinematic games that crib the format of feature films. To take nothing away from such games, What Remains of Edith Finch is a shining example of what video games do uniquely well."
Richard Walker,2017-07-18T04:00:00.000Z,"A singular work of brilliance, What Remains of Edith Finch is one-of-a-kind; a real breath of fresh air that serves as a welcome reminder of video games' capacity to surprise and tell incredible stories. Stunning."
Gareth Brierley,2017-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,My time with What Remains of Edith Finch was perfect and I want to run through it all over again tomorrow. Why don’t you join me?
Bryan Clutter,2017-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch will keep calling back to you after you’ve finished it, and in a way, you’ll want to return to get a better understanding for the story after you know the what and why things happened. My only complaint is that the game was literally over almost as quick as it began. You don’t get to enjoy the individual room sequences as much as I would have liked, because they end within minutes. Either way though, this is an excellent title, and I encourage you to check it out."
Chris Davis,2017-06-23T04:00:00.000Z,"The combination of strict linearity with varied snippets of gameplay might just be the ideal combination for these type of narrative experiences. What Remains of Edith Finch leaps right into my top three games in this genre alongside Gone Home and The Stanley Parable. In fact, I think it’s leapt right to the top."
Josh Brant,2017-06-15T04:00:00.000Z,"Overall, What Remains of Edith Finch is nothing short of a masterpiece. It celebrates life as well as showing you how fragile it is, and how those close to you could one day disappear as easy as they came in—to never take those around you for granted, and understand just how important it is to be a part of life, and the privilege of living. This is one gameplay experience you do not want to miss."
Justin Oneil,2017-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,"Giant Sparrow had me worried about What Remains of Edith Finch with how quiet the game was for several years but I see now they were just working on nailing every little inch of this game. The story of Edith and her family is going to be one I remember for a long time. The characters, house, music, voice acting, and narrative all came together beautifully and I encourage anyone that is a fan of story games to play this game and do it knowing as little as possible."
Rae Grimm,2017-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch is a heartbreaking, playable short story collection that lingers long after the end of the game."
Brett Claxton,2017-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,What Remains of Edith Finch is a great looking game that will be talked about for years to come. Its handling of a usually dark subject matter is delicate and the game mechanics make it stand out in the walking simulator genre.
Hadi Darbani,2017-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,What Remains of Edith Finch takes interactive storytelling into next level by telling a sad and passionate story in the most emotional way possible.
Kyle Haiman,2017-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,"I am not sure when it happened, but at some point, it seems “walking simulator” became a pejorative. As a result, you do not have to look far to find a message board or discussion about renaming the genre to something more representative of what happens in the game: First-Person Experience/Exploration, Interactive Story Adventure, First Person Narrative, and the list goes on and on. It’s accurate you do more than walk in these games, but I do not mind calling the walking simulators…because I tend to like the genre. I enjoyed Firewatch, and Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture, and because of my experience with The Unfinished Swan finding out the folks at Giant Sparrow were making a walking sim had me intrigued. That interest was paid back multiple times over."
Dom D'Angelillo,2017-05-18T04:00:00.000Z,"For want of a better term, What Remains of Edith Finch is a playable family tree. Hidden revelations and unpredictable tragedies complement what is an unnerving but somehow warming experience."
Kat De Shields,2017-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch will satisfy any gamer looking for an experience that can be completed in one sitting, but will linger in mind long after the end credits roll."
Rob Kershaw,2017-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,"Tenderly handling the subject of death while portraying it in interesting ways, Edith Finch is a narrative adventure that deserves to be chronicled."
Mohammad Javad Farajollahi,2017-05-15T04:00:00.000Z,What Remains Of Edith Finch is one of those games that will leave you distressed and depressed for a quite a while. it has an amazing story that easily convinces its players to continue it. if you are tired of action and repetitive games you should definitely give this game a try!
Hossein Sadri,2017-05-14T04:00:00.000Z,"This is about how you born, how you live and how you die. A game about life and death. A game that makes you think about your life. About “What will remain of me?!” No puzzles, No challenges. You are free to follow one of the saddest stories you’ve ever heard. A big house is yours to explore and find the stories of the people who lived there one day. Every member of the family has a story and Giant Sparrow really knows how these stories should be told."
John Phipps,2017-05-12T04:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful, graceful, poignant, heartbreaking, and yet somehow uplifting, What Remains of Edith Finch stands as an example of the absolute pinnacle of storytelling in games. A perfect experience."
Chris Brown,2017-05-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Poignant and powerful, What Remains of Edith Finch has set a new standard in storytelling. Don't be put off by its brevity – these are two of the most enjoyable hours I have ever spent in front of my PC monitor."
Davide Mancini,2017-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,"A game that talks about death, but in doing so it becomes an unforgettable love song to life. Giant Sparrow raises the bar for ""walking simulators"", thanks to an amazing story told through compelling gameplay ideas and some real, deep environmental storytelling."
Aaron Riccio,2017-05-09T04:00:00.000Z,"At its best, the game is a perfect marriage between the telling of a story and one's first-hand engagement with it."
Olivia White,2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,"It's a personal, singular experience that everyone can take part in, and with all my heart, I hope you do."
Sean Davies,2017-05-08T04:00:00.000Z,"A powerhouse of emotional storytelling. Developers Giant Sparrow have taken their previous work on The Unfinished Swan and have improved upon it in every way, creating something truly soul-stirring and evocative with Edith Finch."
Matheus Ricardo Uihara Zingarelli,2017-05-07T04:00:00.000Z,"What Remains of Edith Finch grabs the player's attention until the end, to wonder what the hell happened with the Finch family.  Along with Edith, the last Finch alive, the player experiences the last moments of various family members, going through different generations. Each memory fills in a tiny gap of the mystery, which, in the end, is not what matters the most. What's really important here are the rich experiences that each moment conveys, by means of the story itself or by the diversity of gameplay mechanics applied on each of them. It's a worthwhile title."
Drew Leachman,2022-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door is a fun adventure that offers up some really good exploration and a deliberate, yet fast combat scheme that feels both challenging and rewarding. Going through every nook and cranny of a level never disappoints and progression is handled in such a great way that every play session feels substantial. Fans of the old school Zelda style games should not pass on this one, it’s one that I believe many will enjoy."
Fingal Belmont,2022-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door is a very polished and lovingly crafted action adventure game. It is seemingly a very personal game from the developers and it is steeped with creative ideas in regards to characters and designs. The gameplay is somewhat vanilla, but the ambiance and style elevate the material."
Jake Su,2021-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,"A memorable adventure examining life and death through the lens of a crow, Death’s Door delivers a stunning package of gameplay and storytelling while constantly rewarding the curious."
Chris Garcia,2021-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door is a good example of a game that doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel, but instead polishes it heavily and puts out a clean and satisfying experience that makes it a must-play.

Acid Nerve has kept it simple all throughout, and the game is arguably better for it, trimming a lot of excess fat and giving players a lean 10-hour package that’s a good time from start to finish."
Heather Johnson Yu,2021-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,"There’s a reason why Death’s Door won the 2021 Golden Joystick Award for Best Indie Game and was nominated for the Best Independent Game Award at The Game Awards this year — it’s damn good. Nothing is missing here, every component perfectly balanced against everything else to make for a near-spiritual gaming experience. With gorgeous visuals, a stunning soundtrack, multiple combat styles, a mixture of creative comedy and relatable existential crises, and sprawling environments that naturally invites players to explore every pixel, Death’s Door deserves all the praise it’s received and more."
Miikka Lehtonen,2021-12-10T00:00:00.000Z,"""Angry Birds of Death."""
Rachel Poli,2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door is a fun and unique action-adventure game with appealing scenery and music. You can pick it up and play on the go, and although the controls require skill, it's easy to master."
Antonio J. Rodríguez,2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's doors manages to amalgamate clear references and give them their own personality that enters as well through the eyes as through the control. All this accompanied by a story that, with each step you take, you want to know more and more about the motives of the characters and the chaos behind everything that rules the world."
Diogo Arez,2021-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door is a charming and strikingly beautiful game with fast paced and challenging combat, albeit with some shortcomings that drag it down a bit."
Lorenzo Lombardi,2021-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door is an excellent action-adventure gem, balancing solemnity with laughs and moderate difficulty alongside forgiving mechanics. Its combat is pure and satisfying, and the light-RPG elements make progression enjoyable. What I admired most, though, is how all of these elements work in tandem as Death’s Door offers an adventure that feels fresh. From the exquisite environments and discoverable upgrades/collectibles to the delightful characters, you won’t wanna miss out."
Dillon Van Der Putten,2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door is a prime example of what a dedicated indie team can achieve. It flows incredibly well with incredible combat mixed with some breathtaking visuals. The contrast between the colourful attacks and the bland world works fantastically well, and the controls are crisp and precise. Death’s Door has to be in contention for not only one of the best indie games, but one of the best titles this year in general."
Paul Stuart,2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,"In so many ways, Death's Door is the high end indy title to a tee. It's extremely polished, very creative, terrific for shorter sessions, but lacks a little in depth. Still, it's hard not to recommend Death's Door for fans of the action-adventure, Zelda genre and/or someone looking for something truly different for the Switch. Just note it can be a visual struggle when played in the Switch's portable fashion."
Kieran Toovey,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"In the end though, Death’s Door is a fantastic game. Great visuals, controls, mechanics, and music make it a treat all the way around. With no filler or bloated content, Death’s Door perfectly paces along in its 10 or so hour journey. Theres even more to do and a secret ending for those wanting to extend gameplay."
Scott Adams,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,Death's Door is a game that you can see is crafted with love and purpose. Nothing seems to be done in order to add pointless game time.
Dan Twohig,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door is everything you hope to get get out of an indie game. An addictive challenge, an intriguing little tale and enough content to keep you going back. Unhindered by budgetary restrictions, Death's Door delivers on all fronts. The gameplay feedback from combat is implemented so well that you forget just how simple it is. Better still, it's made all the more excellent by the DualSense controller. Fans of Action RPG's will not want to miss this indy treasure on PS5."
Mitch Vogel,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door is a modern classic, utilizing old gameplay ideas in a new setting to make for a short and sweet experience you won’t want to miss."
Joe Devader,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The soundtrack is also fantastic, with composer David Fenn managing to strike a perfect balance between high energy action and peaceful contemplation. Not to mention the crow you're controlling is just a cute little bird. If you are a fan of action games and have an itch for one that will kill around 8 hours, Death's Door is a pretty good place to clock in and get to work."
Robert Ramsey,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Tight controls, clever level design, and rewarding combat make Death's Door a joy to play. It's a ten-hour adventure that never outstays its welcome, and its overall quality is clear. A polished, quirky, and often challenging title that charms from start to finish."
Arthur Damian,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"In the end, Death's Door is a charming, witty indie game. Its combat is solid, exploration is a blast, and it has just the right length. Though the lack of a map and difficulty options, in addition to a somewhat unstable frame rate, hold the title back a bit, its mix of Dark Souls and Zelda elements is a great fit. It is definitely an adventure worth checking out."
Rodolfo León,2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Despite not doing much in terms of innovation, coupled with a pair of odd framerate issues, Death's Door is a fantasic indie game that seems to do almost everything right. A precise combat, gorgeous environments and a mysterious yet beautiful world, make this an experience you simply can't miss."
Joe Czop,2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall, Death’s Door is an enjoyable homage to 2D Zelda games with some additional quirky flair thrown in. It is a satisfying experience whose main drawback is its overall safeness, plus a lack of replayability. Some may also be turned off by the lack of extreme difficulty, which can be another source of replay value for many similar games. I would recommend Death’s Door to those looking for a nostalgia fix that won’t try your patience or just want to enjoy a memorable and contemplative audiovisual style."
Logan Moore,2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"If you're looking for something bite-sized to dive into before this fall's biggest releases come out, Death's Door is a game to definitely have on your radar. Whether you're a fan of old school adventure games, or you're just looking for a new standout indie, Death's Door is absolutely worth your time, money, and attention."
Ciprian Ghibirdic,2021-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Soul-reaping doesn't seem to be a tedious job, but Death's Door shines a light upon the fictitious scenario in which the afterlife is bureaucratized. In a world where death came to a halt, an unlikely eulogy holds little to no meaning. Living forever has become the norm, a fever dream come true."
Admir Brkic,2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Fast-paced combat, incredible visuals and you also get to play as a cute crow. Perfect for players who want a Zelda-like experience on PC."
Lee Mehr,2021-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The accumulation of so many elements to crow about – characters, polish, creativity, art design, combative pacing, and so on – made it an experience I couldn't put down."
Ed Acosta,2021-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Death’s Door has some fun lore and a fantastic main character; I mean, I love birds, and what’s not to love about a little bird with a sword? The combat is tight, and battles with enemies and bosses never feel unfair. If anything, each failure felt like it was my fault, something I could fix in a future run or my playstyle overall. Everything comes together so well in Death’s Door; it’s just so enjoyable to play. It has become a top ten contender for my games of the year list so far."
Mattia Mariano,2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door is an isometric action adventure game. Thanks to its inspired art direction and well-balanced experience, Death’s Door is simple, linear and funny from the beginning to the end."
Dominic Leighton,2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door is an atmospheric adventure through an inviting fantasy world. It's perfectly crafted, generously provisioned, and an instant indie classic."
Nick Mangiaracina,2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Very few games get as much right with their formula as Death’s Door does.
João Canelo,2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door easily presents itself as one of the best indie games of the year, with excellent art direction and an inviting combat system that never makes the experience tiring."
Dennis Michel,2021-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,Death's Door is the Xbox surprise hit of 2021 that fans of isometric action-adventure should put on their wish list.
Γιώργος Πρίτσκας,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door has very few original ideas, but the flawless implementation of its basic mechanics, combined with a world full of personality and humor, make this ten-hour journey very charming."
افشین پیروزی,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Inspired by works such as Zelda and creating an immaculate balance between surfing, puzzle solving and combat, the game offers fascinating gameplay that doesn't fall out of rhythm until the last minute."
Jon Andoni Ortiz,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door, candidate for the game of the year, where we handle a crow hunting souls. Action, adventure and light-hearted puzzles with an unbeatable technical craftsmanship. Buy it now, trust me."
James Galizio,2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Death's Door's blend of excellent pacing, an engaging combat system, and a haunting aesthetic help elevate it among its peers."
Khari Taylor,2021-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,Players looking for a Souls-borne meets Link From the Past meets Metroidvania experience all wrapped into one need look no further than the delightful Death’s Door; just make sure to pack plenty of patience and don’t let the door hit your face on the way in.
Alessandro Alosi,2020-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Legends of Runeterra is one of the best card games on the market today thanks to the successful mix of accessibility and depth. There are some imperfections to fix, but the experience already is absolutely worth and addictive."
Andrew McKissock,2020-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"The free-to-play virtual card game from Riot Games is a mixture of sleek interface, snappy sound effects, and challenging – yet still accessible – gameplay."
Carlos Hernandez,2020-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Legends of Runeterra is a satisfying online card game that has the potential to be among the best titles in its genre, but the success of this game will be based on the new cards added in the future and how they balance the game while maintaining a fun environment for the community."
Cam Shea,2020-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Unique mechanics, dynamic gameplay and polished presentation make this the collectible card game to beat."
Murat Oktay,2020-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Legends of Runeterra is a great card game. The concept, variety or art of the game makes it the best card game for mobile devices. It will also connect those who love this genre, as it is built on the world of League of Legends."
Ginny Woo,2020-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,Legends of Runeterra brings dynamic card design to life in a way that undeniably draws attention to both its snappy back-and-forth and the colorful world of League of Legends.
Алексей Лихачев,2020-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Legends of Runeterra doesn't reinvent the wheel, but fans of the genre will most likely love it. It doesn't suck your money out and doesn't have tiring or unclear mechanics. All of the new and unusual features look fitting and make the gameplay engaging, even if you are tired of card games."
Charles Hartford,2020-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"The game is fun, interesting and puts enough twists on the tried and true CCG formula to stand out from the crowd. It’s filled with fun personalities and supported by a microtransaction system that doesn’t feel like it’s out to fleece you."
Giovanni Calgaro,2020-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Legends of Runeterra has entered with its head held high in a very difficult and now saturated market like that of digital card games bringing with it a large number of excellent ideas, supported by a first-rate aesthetic, as well as by a mobile counterpart optimized to the fullest."
Matt Cox,2020-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Runeterra might not be packed with interesting decisions, but it is loaded with charm. It’s nice. It’s soothing. That’s enough."
Alleef Ashaari,2020-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Playing Legends Of Runeterra hasn’t suddenly made me a fan of card games or League Of Legends. It’s not that great of a game, but it’s definitely a game that I enjoyed playing and wouldn’t mind returning to from time to time.
Look out, Hearthstone, Shadowverse and all its digital card game ilk, a new title is joining the fray, and it’s a good one."
Gareth Evans,2018-01-19T05:00:00.000Z,"I enjoyed my time with Nioh, especially after playing it co-op with a friend of mine who is a fan of dark souls so we had a good time messing around with the game. The combat is fun, the weapons all have a unique feel backed up by a deep skill system and souls-like stat building to replicate that comfort zone of dark souls but with more dex weapons over strength."
Robert Risdon,2017-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,"For all of the success of KOEI TECMO and Team NINJA's Nioh it seems too often that it is brushed aside as ""Dark Souls with Samurai"" which is a criminal understatement given how good Nioh is."
Chris Davis,2017-07-26T04:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is difficult and the frantic pace of its combat means that even Soulsborne veterans can expect a challenge. The lack of level variety is an issue, however I enjoyed every single fight thanks to the varied and deep combat. With three stances, five weapon types, skills, ninjutsu, and magic, it’s hard to get bored during a fifty to sixty-hour campaign and you’ll likely jump straight into new game plus without stopping for breath. Team Ninja set its sights high with Nioh, seeking to create a samurai-inspired Soulsborne game, with a distinct personality and combat style. Somehow, Team Ninja pulled it off."
Joe Morgan,2017-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is a fantastic Dark Souls-styled game that gives players a more accessible way to approach the genre while handily establishing itself as a potent newcomer to watch in the future. Japanese myth, culture, and history are also fun, interesting, wonderfully executed boons to the budding franchise."
Will Riley,2017-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Nioh does a lot right, and whilst it's obvious it takes a lot of inspiration from the Souls series, it really does feel like a game of its own. That being said, Nioh filled a gap in my heart of tough but rewarding gameplay whilst I wait for the latest Dark Souls DLC to come out, and I'm also confident that Nioh is a game I will keep coming back to for a long time.
If you have a Playstation 4, I will happily go on record with saying that Nioh is an essential game for your library, the stunning visuals, gripping story, and solid gameplay makes the game stand out from a lot of the competition. Whilst I do say it deserves to be merited on its own achievements, for me, it is the game that came closest to encapsulating the feel of the Souls series and Bloodborne, and feels so much more polished than games like Lords of the Fallen. As it stands, Nioh could well be my game of the year."
Michael Jordan,2017-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,Nioh is definitely worth the early frustration and the money to play through.
Pouya Pournasir,2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,Ni-Oh is the most unpredictable gift for PS4 gamers that fascinates Every Souls-Borne fan and everyone who loves to die a lot! combining Ninja Gaiden's Hack N Slash gameplay and Dark Souls mechansim is something every hardcore gamer should experience in his or her life.
Nazih Fares,2017-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is the kind of action-JRPG that we like, and while it’s heavily influenced by Dark Souls and Bloodborne, it has its own charm and original mechanics. Nioh's level design may be rather simple and linear when compared to the sprawling worlds crafted by From Software, but the combat system is dynamic and lives up to the standards of Team Ninja. In short, Nioh is not a simple clone or reskin of Bloodborne as most thought, but rather it combines Bloodborne’s challenging combat with its own mechanics and world-building to form an amazing gaming experience that will entertain fans of From Software games and newcomers to the genre."
Luciano Howard,2017-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,Nioh is a very good game of its own right. It doesn't do anything new but it does deliver one of the deepest combat mechanics inside an engaging action-adventure RPG.
Sean  Cahill,2017-03-10T05:00:00.000Z,"A stunning take on feudal Japan awaits players with a fresh style of leveling, a unique battle system, and a challenge that will make even the most hardened players question what they're doing taking on this game."
James Swinbanks,2017-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,"The combat is tactile and purposeful and the story is one you’ll want to see through, but the grind to do so is long and frustrating one. It fails to take advantage of the way it successfully alters the formula by failing at others and, in doing so, doesn’t end up hitting the heights of the game it derives from so heavily."
Ron Duwell,2017-03-06T05:00:00.000Z,"The thrill of overcoming challenges provided in a game like Nioh simply isn't worth the frustration to me anymore, and I have Team Ninja to thank for finally helping me admit this. It's the ebb and flow of one's life and one's interests, and while I think Nioh is a really solid game that everyone should at least try, it's not the kind of game I want to be playing these days."
Leif Rey Bornales,2017-03-03T05:00:00.000Z,This is an excellent game and a game like this deserves to have a spot in your collection. Whether you're a newbie to challenging games like this or you're a veteran who knows the mechanics too well. This is a game that's worth your money and time. I would happily go back into it to kill another yokai.
Gary Alexander,2017-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,Gary reviews the excellent action samurai game (and Playstation 4 exclusive) Nioh [VIDEO DISCUSSION]
Jordan Rees,2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,Cliche dictates that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Nioh is a game that deserves flattering for years to come.
Charles Blades,2017-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,"Despite these minor critiques, Nioh solidifies the status of roguelikes and their relevance in today’s gaming landscape."
Jerome Delos Santos,2017-02-24T05:00:00.000Z,"Team Ninja’s Nioh is definitely a more stylish, proactive, and traditionally Japanese cousin of the Souls series. The game has definitely defied expectations through being more than the “Souls” game that people thought it would be."
Hamed MohammdPor,2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Being inspired by games like Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden, and Onimusha, Nioh brings neat ideas to the table and can be considered as one of the most well-defined titles and without a doubt, one of the best action role-playing games of the gen."
Tim Bissinger,2017-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh nimmt die Souls-Formel, transportiert sie nach Japan, reichert sie mit Ninja Gaiden und Diablo an und baut einen technischen Rahmen drumherum, auf den andere Entwickler neidisch sein können. Wegen der fehlenden Vielfalt im Gegnerdesign reicht es zwar noch nicht zur Extraklasse - aber das Fundament steht, auf dem jetzt gebaut werden muss."
Pierre-Yves Lanthier,2017-02-22T05:00:00.000Z,Nioh is an amazing game. Yes it has some issues but most of them can be solved in time with some balancing patches. Was it worth the wait? Yes. Was it worth going through all of the Demos to give feedback for the Final Form? Very. William's adventure through Japan is an amazing one and I'm glad that I got to share it with friends as well as going at it alone.
Umar Bastra,2017-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is an absolutely engaging game, that's soul-crushing, yet addictive and satisfying. Nioh continued to impress to the very end, delivering an enthralling experience that's challenging, but fair in its execution."
Rhys Thom,2017-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh offers up a substantial amount of content, with a ton of levels, New Game+  and some “Twilight Missions"". Twilight Missions are revamped levels with better loot drops rates that rotate daily giving players even more content to undertake, but they are currently limited to a select few missions. There is an overwhelming amount of things to do. Some gameplay mechanics may hinder your play style and ultimately get you killed, but nevertheless you could opt not to implement them into your approach."
Keith Mitchell,2017-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,"At first glance, Nioh resembles a Dark Souls clone and that's an unfair comparison. While Nioh draws heavily from Dark Souls, Koei Tecmo has provided more than enough features to put Nioh on the same level as Dark Souls. Plenty of action, an engaging combat system that encourages you to develop your own style of play and it's own charming yet deadly world."
Sean Warhurst,2017-02-20T05:00:00.000Z,"I adored Nioh. Like, straight up marry an inanimate object adore. Is it my favourite Souls type game? Well, no, both Bloodborne and Demons Souls pip it at the post for me. Does it now reside comfortable among my top ten of all time? You betcha."
Jordan Micheal,2017-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,Nioh is an excellent game but the story is badly written. Deserves to be played by Dark Souls and Bloodborne fans.
Jacob Yancey,2017-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is an excellent experience. I don't think that it deserves the perfect scores that many other reviewers are giving it, but it is still a great game that will provide challenging fun from start to finish. If you're a fan of the Dark Souls games and/or Bloodborne, you're guaranteed to like this title. If you've never played a souls-like before, this game is a pretty damn good start."
Hirun Cryer,2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Team Ninja's unforgiving role-playing action adventure set in feudal Japan owes a debt to the Dark Souls series, but with a tone and narrative of its own"
Kai Powell,2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is among the finest exclusives to grace the PS4, melding samurai action with the framework of the well-renowned Dark Souls series, although its devilish difficulty may send William to an early grave."
Tim Reid,2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is a very impressive offering from Team Ninja, mostly thanks to the excellent combat and well-crafted main missions. From Software finally have some serious competition in the sub-genre they invented."
Richard Seagrave,2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"In no uncertain terms, Nioh is something special. It’s one of those rare games that surpasses expectations, taking the best elements from a variety of genre-defining titles whilst sprinkling in a handful of its own ideas."
Jae Lee,2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is a culmination of some of my favorite mechanics in video games. The incredibly fast paced, twitch based reflex combat of Ninja Gaiden. The meticulous strategy and sense of discovery of Souls and the loot/equipment upgrade system of Diablo. It's as though this was a game made specifically for me. If that wasn't enough, Nioh manages to become more than the sum of its parts as something truly exceptional with an identity of its own – one that I simply can't put down and it has secured a spot as the top contender in my game of the year list thus far."
Salman Malik,2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"Nioh is another killer IP that solidifies itself as one of the best in the PS4’s line-up. Team Ninja has redeemed itself by making a game that is not only well thought-out and greatly designed, but also absolutely oozing with charm. I can’t wait to see what Team Ninja makes next after playing this treat of a game."
Marco Cocomello,2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"In the end, Nioh is a magnificent experience that Dark Souls player will love. Is it better than our Game of the Year for 2016? No, but it is a good substitute that does a great job in bringing a new world to life in the grittiest way possible."
Josh Pedroza,2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"For anyone who is a fan of the Souls games, this is an absolute must buy!"
Justin Clark,2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"The game wears its influences on its sleeve, but also puts forth a Herculean effort toward surpassing them."
Tyler Chancey,2017-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"In conclusion, Nioh is a confident and engaging action RPG that wears cultural pride on its sleeve like a badge of honor. An absolutely absorbing time sink that continues to reward and challenge the further and further you go. A masterful return to form for the action chops of Team Ninja, one that I will gladly return to with love even as it pounds me into powder."
Alex Seedhouse,2017-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,"It’s a testament to what an incredible achievement Cave Story+ was, or is, that it still holds up so well, remaining to be an engaging and well-paced adventure from start to finish. I had never expected to fall head over heels for the game as much as I did, wrongly believing that perhaps it wasn’t really for me. But, now that the Mimigas have been saved, all is right the world once more."
António Branquinho,2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,"Cave Story+ is a magnificent metroidvania style with emphasis on platforming action and which brings forth fantastic boss fights, a perfectly designed difficulty curve and overall, a charming and engaging adventure that is set to captivate newcomers and veterans alike. Even if Cave Story+ has existed in previous formats before, it is still a very recommended option to everyone."
Anthony Bacchus,2017-08-01T04:00:00.000Z,Cave Story+ really does feel like a natural fit for the Switch
Khurram Imtiaz,2017-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Cave Story+ is arguably one of the best metroidvania game and despite having released years ago, it still holds up very well even today."
Ryan Brown,2017-07-12T04:00:00.000Z,"This is not a game you want to have to wait for - it is a must-have for a console that it feels to have been made for. It is, as I say, a masterpiece."
Josh Speer,2017-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"All in all, for $29.99 Cave Story+ is still a great deal. It takes all the aspects that make it a classic and further refines them in small ways to offer fans a reason to be excited again. I also personally appreciate that it’s on the Nintendo Switch, especially since the physical version came with sexy preorder bonuses. My only minor complaints are that you can’t skip dialogue and that it’s unclear how to unlock more challenges. Regardless, if you’re a fan of Cave Story already or are just a fan of retro games, I can’t recommend Cave Story+ highly enough. It doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it does remind fans why this game is still relevant today."
Jordan Elek,2017-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,"In order to sell me on a new version of Cave Story in 2017, I needed to see a significant amount of new content—new weapons, new areas, new playable characters, new choices. Without any of those things, Cave Story+ is a short, simple, fun experience that doesn’t quite live up to the standard set by similar games in the time since Cave Story originally released."
Steve Bowling,2017-06-20T04:00:00.000Z,"If you haven't played Cave Story yet, you need to; it's an essential title for any fan of Metroidvania style games. Its wonderful pacing, fantastic controls and charming visuals make it a must-have for fans of the genre, especially those that have yet to play it. If there was the equivalent of a required reading list for games, Cave Story+ would be on it."
A.J. Maciejewski,2017-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,Countless fantastic 2D action games released since Cave Story initially debuted yet it remains a wonderful experience that every genre fan needs to play.
Zachary Miller,2017-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,"Cave Story+ isn't the definitive version of Cave Story—I think that crown still belongs to the WiiWare version, but then again, that version isn't portable. I do miss the ability to switch graphical styles, but it's really the only regrettable absentee. The real takeaway here, though, is Cave Story is great and you should play it."
Renan Fontes,2017-06-05T04:00:00.000Z,Cave Story+ isn't just a good game in 2017; it's downright impressive.
Albert Lichi,2022-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez is a very easy-going experience for the most part, but it is also very capable of presenting a diabolical challenge to anyone looking for one. The descent to an otherworldly nightmare glitch-world is something that is not often done in video games, yet it makes a lot of sense; especially for something that focuses on a theme of perception and dimension. While the creator of Fez may have his issues, his game has very few and is very pleasant to play."
Evan Rowe,2021-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"FEZ is the perfect confluence of beautiful visuals, deeply satisfying gameplay, a richly designed world, tightly interconnected systems, an astounding soundtrack, and fantastic pacing. Seldom are games this well composed, and it feels mostly as fresh today as it did the day it came out. This is the definition of a classic; it endures time and shows the mastery of its work as it ages. It will always be one of my favorites, and I can think of no more fitting a place to experience FEZ, be it for the first time or the tenth."
Josh Speer,2021-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Ultimately, I have more positive things than negative to say about FEZ. Sure it can be cumbersome and confusing at times, but it’s still a beautiful and creative game. It’s nice I was finally able to play this one-time exclusive on a Nintendo console. And though I didn’t 100% beat the game, I at least got one of the endings before writing this up. Now armed with my cool shades, I might be able to find the other hidden 32 cubes and maybe learn the true secrets underpinning the world of FEZ. If you enjoy puzzles, platformers, and indies, I’d definitely give this one a shot. Just don’t be ashamed if you need to consult a couple of guides online."
Vítor M. Costa,2021-04-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez has a unique and visionary aesthetic, after all it is not trivial to unite the concept of Ueda with a visual style of the 8-bit era and that can be, at the same time, charismatic and profound; as well as mysterious and humorous. Fez's problems are few, probably the most serious of them being the fact that it is not very challenging: it is very easy to inductively solve the puzzles, and the real challenge is to find the hidden anti-cubes, but they are optional."
James Luff,2021-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez to this day still remains quite a unique and original puzzle platformer with a charming graphical style to boot. This is a nice fit if you’re looking for a casual experience away from the dexterity and quick reflexes of other platformers. But if you are someone that likes to 100% you may need a guide to discover all the secrets.

The Switch version of Fez offers nothing new to the experience so there’s no reason to double dip if you’ve already had your Fez fill on a previous system. But if this is your first venture into the game or you want to introduce a friend to it, then have at it."
Neal Ronaghan,2021-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The way the game opens up as you play, revealing secrets on top of secrets is something I've never seen another game land quite as well. What stands out most to me about Fez after nine years is that I'm in the midst of my third playthrough and even with some of the sheer novelty being lessened, I'm as enthralled as I was back in 2012. Fez stands as a truly unique indie game that draws inspiration from classics but is wholly its own precious and maddening experience that needs to be played."
Thomas Pillon,2021-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"On Switch or not, Fez is an incredible experience, strong and deep like very few games do. Whether you already played it somewhere else or not, Phil Fish's game is a must-have and did not aged a bit, even in 10 years."
Leonardo Faria,2021-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,"In short, Fez is as good now as it has always been. The reason I call this version the best way to experience this indie game is mostly due to the perfect combination of the Switch’s portability and its screen being much larger than the Vita’s. This is easily one of the best indies ever made, and one of the most important games of the past decade."
Alex Olney,2021-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"FEZ is a fun, challenging puzzle platformer fit to burst with original ideas and unique gameplay wrinkles. Its puzzles bend reality and even leech into our own world on occasion, but aside from a few select mega-challenges never stray into the category of too obtuse or unfair. A few visual and mechanical quirks stop this from being a perfectly polished experience, but these are outweighed by its charm and other wonderful qualities ninefold. It's another one of those 'games you have to play' on Switch, and it couldn't be more at home."
Steven Tench,2015-08-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Fez, despite what faults I personally found with it, is by no means a bad game, and is easy enough to cope with given the aid of a strategy guide to go along with it. However, I, along with the entire industry can only imagine what Fez 2 would have been like if it had have been developed as originally planned."
Domenico Musicò,2014-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Even PlayStation users finally have the opportunity to try one of the most important works released outside the indie undergrowth, able to soar with arrogance even among the most prominent titles of the time thanks to its captivating formula, made with a care at times maniacal. FEZ is now a piece of modern video game history that certainly needs to be recovered."
Dominic Leighton,2014-04-17T04:00:00.000Z,"The ability to play across all of your systems, and transfer effortlessly between them, cannot be overstated, and the fact that you only have to pay once for it is an ideal that some companies are sadly still avoiding. Whilst there isn't necessarily much of a traditional challenge to the game, working your way through the different worlds is so enjoyable that you'll barely notice."
Özgür Yıldız,2014-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Successful visuality, different puzzle structure, interesting story, cross-buy feature is enough to buy for a single platform, Cross-save."
Nate Kiernan,2014-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,"Everything shines in FEZ with the sort of passion you only see in indie projects, and I am so very happy that it found its release and I was able to take part in it myself."
Matthew Codd,2014-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,All that for $18.95? You'd have to be a Square not to.
Shaan Joshi,2014-04-07T04:00:00.000Z,"I used to think that the joy of exploration and unbridled sense of discovery was lost to the games of consoles past, but Fez has not only proven me completely wrong, but it has given me hope for the future."
Fabio Bortolotti,2014-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"An absolute masterpiece. A unique experience that satisfies the eyeballs, timpani, brain and even the heart."
Bradley Marsh,2014-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"So what of Fez? Who is it for? The answer to that is everyone. If you haven't played before, then you must pick it up instantly, hell even if you played and completed, it is the sort of game that you will be happy to play through again. If you get it on PSN, you don't even need to settle on a single platform, what we can say is that the PSN release if the definitive version of Fez. Stop what you are doing and buy it now."
Brendan Griffiths,2014-04-01T04:00:00.000Z,"Fez isn't as fresh as it was two years ago and is purposefully frustrating by design at times with its pretentious refusal to adhere to a few sensible design decisions. There's a lot of effort required to progress and the game offers little back in return. If it could talk, it would say,""Play me or don't, I'm too cool to care."" So you may want to punch it right in its Michael Cera, but the forgiving attitude to failure and the admittedly neat world-rotating to explore every surface to find more cubes may pull you in. Try the demo first though."
Jeremy Parish,2014-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,"A novel exploration of the underpinnings of game graphics, Fez at once pays tribute to classic 2D platformers while revealing the shenanigans that went into their design. Borderline inscrutable at times, Fez is a puzzle on many levels. Yet its mysteries, clever as they are, deserve to be unravelled."
John Fleury,2014-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,"Fez offers a clever gameplay premise and a charming, minimalist presentation, but its overly open-ended nature and confusing navigation system detract from the overall package."
Adam Byrne,2014-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Fez is a resounding success, marrying a stunning score, innovative gameplay and a gorgeous art direction into a complete interwoven package. Little Gomez's journey is one of discovery and wonder and should rightfully find its home on PlayStation 4's across the land."
Adam Beck,2014-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Over the course of two years, Fez has somehow been able to break out of its Xbox Live Arcade confines, re-releasing on PC and now Sony's platforms. As it remains, this is still one of the most charming, charismatic adventures you will have, leaving those who experience it with a smile across their face for the duration of their play."
Francesco Fossetti,2014-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,"There is an element that stands out more than others, in that set of suggestions, quotes and atmospheres set up by Phil Fish: the beauty of craftsmanship. Fez is a title built pixel by pixel, over an interminable five years: a project that has voraciously accumulated ideas, artistic registers, original and traditional gameplay dynamics. The result is a real gem, a title that shines at the highest levels of the platform genre, and succeeding from start to finish to tease, intrigue and excite the player. The arrival on Sony platforms, after the hands of its creator, is a blessing. Don't miss this opportunity."
Roger Hargreaves,2014-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,The game may never live down the notoriety of its designer but this is still one of the most entertaining and imaginative indie games of the last decade.
Grégory Szriftgiser,2013-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"If Fez is indeed a gem, he is not as polite as his peers, the Limbos and other Braids. But despite its bugs and inaccuracies, Fez is a smart game, made for lovers of puzzles and puzzles, those who like to take the lead, as much as exploring enchanting worlds and deliciously referenced 8bit. Personally, I completely cracked, and scribbling symbols, diagrams, in search of its secrets made me reconnect with a simple pleasure of play: that of discovering without being taken too much by the hand."
Mitch Dyer,2013-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez is a brilliant, beautiful platformer. Play it immediately."
Arthur Gies,2012-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez is the most authentic exploration of the NES era of games that I've ever played, from its sound and visuals to its obtuseness. It uses the capabilities of current systems to take those ideas further, while limiting itself with specific intentions, deploying scrutability in bits and pieces. It doesn't just love the games it borrows from — it understands them. It knows what it is and what it wants to be, and doesn't compromise on it. And for those willing to bury themselves in Fez's alien world and logic, there are plenty of treasures to be found."
Brian Dumlao,2012-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Given the amount of development time and the public nature of the game, Fez no longer seems like a revolutionary title. The puzzle mechanics has been used in several different ways in other games (that were released earlier), and the move away from realism and into a more whimsical, older look has also been done by other titles. The graphics and sound are still charming, even if it falters in a few places. More importantly, the game does a great job of throwing in a number of obtuse and brain-melting puzzles, and the sense of elation when you finally solve them is second to none. Those who love a good challenge will have some fun with this well-made puzzle platformer."
Laura Cawley,2012-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,"For what is a very reasonable price of 800MSP, Fez is a game that will give you hours of gameplay. There are still questions unanswered, even with the collective mind of the internet, so who knows how much the game has to offer. I do know that, even now, you will get a lot of enjoyment and frustration from this game if you are at all interested in puzzles. The cuteness and originality far exceeded my first expectations, and bodes for an overall excellent game."
James Cottee,2012-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"But quibbles aside, Fez is brilliant."
Susan Arendt,2012-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez straddles the line between platformer and puzzler, taking the best from each genre and blending it into a refreshing whole. It doesn't punish experimentation or require advanced controller skills, letting you discover the game's secrets at your own pace."
Scott Nichols,2012-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez is ultimately a game about games much in the same way Hugo is a film about films. Fez can be very demanding to get the most out of it, but without ever actually asking anything of you. Do not play Fez to beat it, but play to explore and get lost in its puzzles and pixilated world."
Przemysław Zamęcki,2012-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Fez was formed in pain for several years. It was worth the wait - it's by far the best adventure-platform game available on Xbox 360 on Xbox LIVE Arcade. This title may have been about two years late to be called a milestone for the development of the independent games or games scene in general, but it is possible to pin it on the label of a work of art without fear. What I hereby do and encourage you to personally convince all readers of this."
Chloe Osborn,2022-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,"I’ve had Chicory: A Colorful Tale sitting in my Steam wishlist for quite a while, after seeing it come up on Twitter. What caught my eye was the illustrated animal characters and the focus on painting powers, seeing as I like to illustrate myself. Not wanting to spoil any more of the game, I added it to my wishlist in the hopes of returning to it when I had the money."
Willem Hilhorst,2022-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The soundtrack is stellar and completes the package on display here. It's a game that can be enjoyed for all ages and if you decide to pursue all the sidequests, complete the decorating minigames, and find all of the collectibles, you can certainly spend a lot of time in the world of Chicory. My only gripe is a personal one-that I didn't play this game last year-because without a doubt it makes for a wonderful late addition to the best of what 2021 had to offer. I cannot wait to see what Greg, Lena, Em, Alexis and Madeline will make next, because Chicory can't be described as anything other than a piece of modern art."
Sérgio Mota,2022-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale has a simple principle, but its gameplay quickly gains a dynamic of its own. The result is a fantastic work that puts painting at the centre of the adventure and will lead the player into completely unexpected paths. Thanks to the Nintendo Switch touch screen and the ability to play anywhere, Chicory: A Colorful Tale finds a perfect home in this console and it fits just right with anyone looking for a fun and enveloping adventure."
Amelia Fruzzetti,2021-12-27T00:00:00.000Z,"There’s so much more I could go on about – the customizability, the perfect pacing and length, the world map thrice as rich and dense as Zelda 1’s, the little moments of LGBT rep, the charm of all the names, how it manages it be more than the sum of its already gorgeous parts – but I don’t know if I’d be able to stop. Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a special game, one as finely crafted as it is sentimentally inspired, brimming with color for an experience so seemingly monochromatic.

There’s only one word for it: art."
Stuart Gipp,2021-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,"As an adventure game, Chicory is quite sincerely up there with the very best of the genre. There's plenty to see and do and a full completion run will probably take you 25-30 hours. The characters and their travails are rich and likeable, the game's sense of humour is generally inspired, and it's all very sweet without being sugary-twee and talking down to the player. It's also an affecting little tearjerker that will definitely strike a chord if you make art, and almost certainly will even if you don't – so long as you're capable of pretty basic empathy. Chicory is simple to play but impressively long and complex, with perfect controls, performance and visuals. Throw yourself into painting the world and you'll be left with a game that's very much your own and speaks to you directly – a beautiful marriage of mechanics, themes and visuals."
Paula Moore,2021-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a delightful adventure. It has an intriguing story, innovative gameplay mechanics, well-written characters, engaging puzzles, and a heart-warming story. Now that the game has been released on the Nintendo Switch, I think it’s found the perfect home. I highly recommend you give Chicory: A Colorful Tale a try. If I could, I’d give it four thumbs up. I love it!"
Seth Hay,2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a unique indie game that not only lets players be the artist but also delivers a powerful message along with excellent gameplay and a whimsical soundtrack. It deserves to be on everyone’s radar to play and is a strong candidate for one of the best games of 2021.
Nick Cooney,2021-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale perfectly embraces the “don’t judge a book by its cover” metaphorical phrase. It lulls you into a false sense of security with its charmingly simple visuals and cute anthropomorphic characters. The depth found within its story is unexpected, surprising, and frankly wonderful storytelling. The focus on mental health is eye-opening, self-affirming and a great opportunity to learn. This is all wrapped up in a therapeutic and fun colouring game with a powerful soundtrack."
Jordan Biordi,2021-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is an absolute delight—fun, engrossing, and bursting with creativity!"
Sean Garmer,2021-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"From a fantastic story and endearing characters to varied puzzles and a great soundtrack there is just so much to love about Chicory: A Colorful Tale. Its coloring book world leaves everything open for your interpretation, but also doesn't force you to spend any more time with it than what is actually required. I loved every minute I spent with the game and it is easily my favorite game of 2021 so far."
Sam Wachter,2021-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Despite not everything going off without a hitch, and some systems sure to appeal more to certain kinds of gamers, Chicory’s emotional core is so strong, so impactful that it eclipses all other shortcomings and just leaves the player with an overwhelming feeling of pathos."
Bree Swaine,2021-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful tale is an adorable little adventure with clever puzzles, cute writing, characters and hardstyle. The painting mechanics are incredibly well utilized and keep the gameplay constantly fresh while the gripping story keeps you wanting to play more and more. It also has plenty of secrets and items to find that keep the game replayable if you want to continue exploring. These things alone would make a good game, but the intelligent and heartfelt story is what makes it amazing. You learn so much about the characters and yourself while playing Chicory and it teaches such wonderful lessons that are applicable to anyone of any age. The writing and the world work together so perfectly to create an experience that is both fun and cute, while also being deeply profound. It isn’t a grand, sweeping story. It is small, it is personal and it hits incredibly close to home."
Ben Reeves,2021-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory is an intriguing world full of hilarious characters and inventive game mechanics, which makes it a delight from start to finish"
Nimmi Faiya,2021-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"From the quests to the main story, Chicory: A Colorful Story is a great time that will keep players’ attention till the end."
Tiago Herrmann,2021-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a bittersweet, powerful and human game that isn't afraid to demonstrate how depression can trick. Dyed in neutral, cool and warm colors, the title published by Finji is about fears and insecurities, but it also reminds us of the importance of being here moving forward, because absolutely everything we do is wonderful and always good enough."
Hope Corrigan,2021-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,Chicory: A Colorful Tale has you revitalise a colourless world. But that task comes with more existential dread than you might think.
Jayden Hellyar,2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a stunning game that should be on everyone's list of games to play. It features plenty of creative gameplay mechanics, which proved to be engaging with very minimal faults. The storyline is also incredibly charming, and you'll likely struggle to find a more wholesome game than Chicory."
Josh Wise,2021-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale is bound to the template set forth by The Legend of Zelda, but, rather than offering reflexive glibness, or inking the affair with irony, its critique wraps warmly around its subject, like a scarf."
Dalton Cooper,2021-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,Chicory: A Colorful Tale is a compelling twist on The Legend of Zelda formula that will appeal to fans of Nintendo's popular franchise.
Alessandro Barbosa,2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,Satisfying puzzles and cathartic painting mechanics support Chicory: A Colorful Tale's strikingly relatable story about self-doubt.
Mattia Ravanelli,2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory teach everyone else how to tackle some real issues about our society and, ultimately, our life. But its gameplay lacks that spark that made Wandersong great."
A.J. Maciejewski,2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,Video games don't get much more heartwarming than Chicory: A Colorful Tale with its beautifully-interwoven gameplay and story.
Shaun Joy,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"You get a masterpiece of heart, filled with moments that will touch, but clever design that fills every aspect of the game. Make no mistake: don't miss this one."
Austin Jones,2021-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Lena Raine's fabulous soundtrack also must be commented on, which glistens with life but feels airy and sparse as if to mimic the gaps in color you have to fill over the course of the game. Despite being a pretty ""wholesome"" game, it doesn't mince words and never presents a simple solution to serious issues. I'm really happy I played Chicory-it's one I truly needed to play, and I hope a lot of people get something out of it too."
Nathan Hermanson,2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"As I approached the end of Chicory, wiping tears out of my eyes and grinning like a fool, it became immediately apparent that this game had broken through as one of those special games. As one of my favorites of all time. At some point, I knew where Chicory would rank in my books, and it blew me away. I didn't think we'd get here so soon, but . . ."
Nicole Carpenter,2021-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Instead, Chicory asks, ""What if there's a better way?"" A person's worth is inherent, and it's not chosen for us. If we tear down those systems and rebuild something new, we can shift legacies and choose them for ourselves - it's no longer a gift bestowed upon us by some unfair, undated structure. With a little practice, maybe anyone can wield a paintbrush."
Rubén Manzanares,2021-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory a Colorful Tale, is a great metroidvania with certain influences on classic titles but that stands out for its great ideas, creating a special title that I recommend adding to the library, in case you want to live a unique experience. A title with a great sound and artistic section in which you will be the artist in charge of giving color."
Kenzie Du,2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The world is your oyster - or rather, your canvas - in the charming and expressive adventure, Chicory: A Colorful Tale. Paint the world in the colors of your choosing and solve the mystery of why the world has gone black-and-white!"
Kim Snaith,2021-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,"If you like the idea of an open world adventure filled with wonderfully written characters, engaging puzzles and a heart-warming story, don’t hesitate to give Chicory: A Colorful Tale a try. It’s so much more than “a game you colour in yourself”; it’s a journey filled with heart and soul. It isn’t free of frustrations, but they’re easily forgiven thanks to just how charming and wonderfully unusual this adventure is."
Kwangseok Park,2021-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"'Chicory: A Colorful Tale' is an adventure game that anyone can enjoy lightly like a coloring book. You can feel stable while filling maps with various colors, and fall in fun with well-organized Zelda style puzzles and actions."
James Bentley,2021-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory is a wonderful, creative outing that is as grounding as it is it bursting with charm."
Jonathan Leo,2021-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Long story short, Chicory embodies the one major word that keeps us going: hope. All wrapped up in a charming title."
Andrew Thornton,2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Chicory: A Colorful Tale spoke to me deeply. I think most people who have pursued any creative outlet will find something to latch onto in its story. If that were the only strength here, you’d have a game worth your time. When you combine that with a beautiful art style, fantastic music, entertaining exploration, thought-provoking puzzles, and unique boss battles, you have a masterpiece. Coming out during the lead-up to E3, the same week that several other heavy hitters release, it would be easy for Chicory to get lost in the shuffle. Don’t let them happen. Few games releasing in 2021 will be more worthy of your time."
Toni Soininen,2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,"""The best 2D Sonic since the first three."""
Jeffrey L. Wilson,2017-09-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania distills Sonic down to its basic elements, resulting in a wonderfully lean Hedgehog throwback. Unfortunately, DRM issues prevent Sonic Mania from blazing a truly excellent trail."
Shaun Joy,2017-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"It gets the Sonic Formula right, it just doesn't KO with anything new. But that's ok: because what's here is solid."
Gary Sheppard,2017-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Finally, we have the return to form that Sonic fans have been waiting for all these years. This isn't just one of the best Sonic games of recent years, but one of the best Sonic games full stop. You owe it to yourself to get a copy of this masterpiece."
"Kyle Movius,Elisha Deogracias",2017-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,"Whether you like the old Sonic games or the new ones, or even if you've never played one before, Sonic Mania holds plenty of fun for everyone."
Álvaro Oliveira Almeida,2017-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,Best Sonic 2D of all times.
Parham Aghakhani,2017-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania is not only one of the best titles in the series, but is also one of the best platformer games in recent years. It's clear that this game is made by people who really love the series and definitely knew what they were doing; because it's full of nostalgia, color, passion and personality. If you're a fan of sonic series or platformer games, you should not miss Sonic Mania"
Nicholas Leon,2017-09-06T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania is a franchise's identity found. It's simple, it's straightforward, it's what Sonic should be. The developers have gone back to the drawing board and have given new life to a franchise hat was on its last legs just a few years ago. This may be new life into the series, and here's hoping that it continues to be so."
Francis DiPersio,2017-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,"If you’ve been waiting for Sonic’s grand return to the spotlight, your wish has finally been granted. Sonic Mania is as good as it gets, proving that sometimes a franchise needs to rediscover its roots to move forward."
Chris Davis,2017-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"Great Sonic games are a novelty these days. Fortunately, the novelty doesn’t wear off in a hurry. Sonic Mania is fast, fun, and full of surprises, from the first level until the last."
Chris Jecks,2017-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"In the nearly 20 years since Sonic Adventure, it turns out all Sonic needed was a developer who actually understood what made a good Sonic game. Mania is a joyous non-stop celebration of everything you ever loved about Sonic The Hedgehog, with perfectly designed levels, and controls that feel just right.."
Ron Duwell,2017-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania is for everyone, and everyone should buy it. It succeeds at being a love letter to SEGA's classic days just as much as it succeeds at being a smartly designed video game with all of the reasons in the world to return to it over and over again. Older fans will love it, newer fans will love it, parents can play it with their kids."
O'Dell Harmon Jr.,2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,"I'm glad I lived long enough to see another great Sonic game; one that doesn't need the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia.  It has learned from the past and forged its own identity. It's not perfect, but it is a new standard that series needed. Believe the Mania because the Blue Blur is back."
Andy Kelly,2017-09-01T04:00:00.000Z,A breakneck platformer that uses classic Sonic as a foundation for something fresh and exciting.
نواف النغموش,2017-08-31T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania never managed to find solutions for the series' problems. However, it returned what attracted many players after 24 years with a new layer, sending a message that the series still has an opportunity of improvement."
Cody Medellin,2017-08-30T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania is a must-have title for platforming fans, retro enthusiasts, and Sonic fans of all types. It captures the essence of what made the series memorable, with a balance of high speed and thoughtful level design that guides you to secrets but always takes you to the end. Boss fights are inventive, and the title's replay value is immense, given the unlockables and various available pathways based on your chosen character. All we can hope for now is an official sequel, spiritual or otherwise, from these same fans-turned-programmers."
Nathaniel Smyth,2017-08-28T04:00:00.000Z,"If Christian Whitehead just keeps making new Sonic levels, and SEGA lets him head more games, then the future of Sonic will be bright. Hats off to you, Mr. Whitehead."
Richard Dobson,2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,"The nostalgia felt when playing Sonic Mania means that SEGA have done a fantastic job. It looks the part, sounds the part and most importantly plays the part. It’s more challenging than I remember, but this is quite possibly due to there being a lot of new elements to the levels to learn, and my muscle memory from the old games counts for nothing here. There is plenty of replayability here though, so maybe one day those memories will return."
Brandon Orselli,2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,"It truly made me feel like I was playing Sonic the Hedgehog again for the very first time. I legitimately got choked up at how perfectly this game captures the magic of the originals, yet expands upon it. Let's hope that Sonic Forces is able to capture the same magic that Sonic Mania has."
Ovidio Fuentes,2017-08-27T04:00:00.000Z,Sonic Mania brings the best that the classics had to offer and then goes Super Sonic on you.
Joseph Choi,2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,"This game’s critical success should be a wake-up call for Sega to rethink their approach to Sonic in general. Although I can’t speak from the perspective of someone who didn’t grow up on Sonic, I truly believe this game boasts cross-generational appeal. Anyone who appreciates challenging, well-designed 2D platforming should find a lot to love here."
Clarice Kehoe,2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,My experience with Sonic Mania has been a blast and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing my old childhood game. I feel as if Sonic Mania is well deserving of the scores it has received and has brought Sonic back into its golden days.
Danreb Victorio,2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,"It’s clear that Sonic Mania was made with a lot of tender loving care, and with all the fans this game is set to please in addition to finding new ones, it would be a shame if Sega doesn’t name Christian Whitehead and company the new Sonic Team."
Ed Acosta,2017-08-24T04:00:00.000Z,"Even with the small issues, Sonic Mania is a love letter to Sonic fans. As it should be though, it was designed by fans for the fans. Sonic Mania is right up there with the best Sonic titles and an excellent throwback that longtime fans have been hoping and waiting for – myself included."
Matthew Zimmari,2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,"Despite its flaws, Sonic Mania is the type of game that players can keep going back to over and over. It has the replayability of the classic Sonic games with minor modernisations for current day gamers, and is sure to appeal to old and new players alike. For a franchise that for a while seemed to flounder and suffer from subpar titles, it offers hope to fans that there will be more to return the series to its former glory."
Angus Deacon,2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,A nostalgic platforming remix-o-rama made with love.
Ollie Barder,2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,"Overall, Sonic Mania is probably one of the best Sonic games ever made and is a very carefully and thoughtfully crafted game."
Gareth Harmer,2017-08-23T04:00:00.000Z,"I’ve thoroughly enjoyed Sonic Mania, and it’s a clear example of just how successful fan-created passion projects can be when they’re nurtured by a studio. I’m also hopeful that the 2D journey doesn’t end here either, but encourages Sega to continue further down this road with even more new content in the future. In the meantime, 3D fans have Sonic Forces to look forward to when it launches later this year."
Russell Collom,2017-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Sonic games have always been a roller coaster when it came to quality with often the best ones being the games that closely related back to past Sonic games. Sonic Mania, pulling inspiration from specifically the 2D versions of Sonic planned to not only offer a compelling return to form but also showcase how excellent a new Sonic game can be. Thankfully SEGA and significant developers of the Sonic community have brought this dream to life in what quite possibly is the best Sonic game yet."
Anthony Preece,2017-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,A prime example of how retro console gaming can still be fun AND relevant. Cracking good fun...
Daniel Stroński,2017-08-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania for as little as €20 contains everything what's best in the classic entries, and many fresh ideas. Must-have for all fans of the blue hedgehog – but only for them."
Dean James,2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic fans have been waiting for a game that finally built on the legacy of the Genesis era Sonic games and Sonic Mania has finally captured that magic that has been missing. Bringing in a true Sonic fan to take the reigns of the series was very much the right decision and you can tell the level of loving detail put into every aspect of the game. It may have taken a long time, but everybody’s favorite Blue Blur is finally back in Sonic Mania and it feels so good."
Ivan Nikolai Barkow Castilho,2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania has the essence of the classic Genesis games offering a variety of stages with new and nostalgic features. It is possible to see the passion of the developers in creating a game with what the fans wanted when it comes to graphics, soundtrack and above all the gameplay."
Will Borger,2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Incredible levels, beautiful art, a fantastic soundtrack and classic gameplay make Sonic Mania the best Sonic game in years."
Gabriel Jones,2017-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Sonic Mania doesn't just stand shoulder to shoulder with the classics of yesteryear; it surpasses them. The level design is absolutely incredible. Each zone features a wealth of obstacles and secrets, and they're all superbly implemented. Players are given ample opportunity to explore, though there's also incentive in speeding to the end."
Yagmur Sevinc,2022-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"If you’re looking for a game like Animal Crossing, you have found it. If you’re looking to spend a few hours on an experience that will stick with you, this is your game. Even though there is almost nothing to return to after you finish it, A Short Hike is a great experience that is well worth the four hours of your life."
Donovan Erskine,2021-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike is a delightful journey through a vibrant park, bolstered by some fascinating characters and impressive writing. The gameplay is well-rounded, with abilities that are fun to use and a consistent progression. Despite a nitpick or two, there’s hardly anything to knock about Adamgryu’s latest outing."
Matt Lorrigan,2021-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike is a wonderfully chill little game that can easily be finished in the space of an afternoon, combining clever traversal mechanics with a lo-fi visual style and a very relatable protagonist. If you’ve got a couple of hours to kill over a weekend, or after a stressful day of work, A Short Hike is an easy recommendation."
Alan Strawbridge,2021-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,"As whimsical and relaxing lo-res indie adventure games go, A Short Hike is up there with the best. It draws you in with its freewheeling 'go where you like' vibe, charms you with some beautiful artwork and music and offers up great pleasures in exploration as you stroll, climb and glide around the small mountainous island. You'll only be there for a few hours, but every moment is a chilled out pleasure."
Kim Snaith,2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,"If you enjoy casual adventuring and games that you can take at your own pace, A Short Hike is not to be missed. It may be short in name and in nature, but every moment you spend with it will warm your soul. Don’t rush to the finish line – enjoy the journey and make the most of what you discover along the way. It’s a life lesson we should all take to heart."
Graham Banas,2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Ultimately, the extra bits draped around the core experience are the real star, offering up a helping of charm and wit that help sell the title as a cosy little experience worth your time, even if you might not have much cause to return to it once you’re done."
Heidi Hawes,2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I truly cannot recommend A Short Hike enough. The trailer is both misleading and yet also tells you exactly what you can expect. The experience you have and what you’ll get out of it is up to you. If you skimp on the side stuff and only focus on getting to the top of the mountain, then you’ll probably feel disappointed, especially since you can do so in under an hour. If you take your time fully exploring the island and helping the locals, then you’ll discovery a surprisingly rich and rewarding experience. A Short Hike is a journey you won’t soon forget."
Patrick Schmees,2021-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,"No pun intended, A Short Hike’s main hike up to the summit of Hawk Peak is brief, taking only around 1-2 hours to complete. Despite a short storyline, there are plenty of side quests and activities to explore off the beaten path. Moreover, the game provides a tranquil and low-stress experience with the aid of flight and a beautiful soundtrack. In short, A Short Hike is worth exploring as a way to get away and unwind from a busy world and its cell phone signals."
Achi Ikeda,2020-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Though A Short Hike doesn’t bring much new to the table (many elements will feel similar to Journey, Celeste, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Animal Crossing, or Stardew Valley), the game combines familiar mechanics so well that A Short Hike, despite a few small drawbacks, is a well put together, relaxing game you shouldn’t miss out on."
Mauro Ferrante,2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,A small gem that tells the story of its developer and let player experience a short-yet-incredibly fascinating adventure.
Yvonne van Geloven,2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike offers a wholesome experience for a small price. Though the game is short, it’s worth every penny. Put yourself in Claires shoes (do bluebirds wear shoes?) and explore this lovely landscape. Meet all kinds of characters and help them in their quest. Most of all: glide through the air, truly as free as a bird!"
Mitch Gardner,2020-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Although A Short Hike is — as the name suggests — a rather short game, its combination of humour and emotion captures the player in a way that many AAA games fail to. If you’ve got a spare $10 and a couple of hours to kill, definitely pick up A Short Hike for the Nintendo Switch!"
Raoni Mendes Pinheiro,2020-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike is short and sweet, just like a tiny chocolate bar. You know that each bite will be worth it, but the experience definitely lasts for a short time. Going beyond a ""mere"" video game, A Short Hike resembles a poem or an interactive work of art at different times, while still managing to be a legitimately fun game in the process."
Chan Khee Hoon,2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"With gentle, idyllic charm, A Short Hike is a delightful vignette about the joys of hiking and meeting new friends."
Marco Mottura,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike is a delightful experience: simple, contained, collected in ambition, yet so rich in character and emotion. Thanks to a very valuable artistic direction, a level soundtrack, brilliant controls and remarkable writing, Adam Robinson-Yu's small great experiment proves to be a bon-bon of gameplay style: the trip that anyone should give themselves (also because the cost is literally that of a pizza ...) at the end of a strange and different summer. Unmissable, see you up there, at the top."
Stuart Gipp,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,A landmark game for all ages. Don't miss this one.
João Canelo,2020-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Chill, relaxed and, like the name suggests, short."
Trevor Gould,2020-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike is a game the whole family can love. It's an homage to classics while still very much it's own release. There is much to explore, fun characters to interact with, and the entirety of the title just had me smiling. Carve out a couple of hours in your day, curl up with some 'Strawberries and Toast,' and give A Short Hike a play. You won't regret it."
Willem Hilhorst,2020-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"It's perfect for new players, looking to play something for a short while, but also respects experienced players by giving them the freedom to play the game however they choose. The charm the game brings to the table is reason enough for me to return time and time again to this world. It's a feel-good zenlike game and I'm so incredibly happy that I can now return to this world at any time on the Switch. Finally it is only A Short Hike away."
Ari Sadler,2020-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,When you play A Short Hike to its fullest you receive a wholesome experience. This is a positive game with positive characters and positive metaphors that I will admit are a bit on the nose.
Heather Johnson,2020-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike stayed in my backlog for far too long, but the truth is, there wasn’t a better time than now to play it. With quarantine canceling many summer vacations, those of us trapped in urban jungles have likely been longing for the beauty of the wild outdoors. Even in its low-poly form, A Short Hike delivers on the experience, healing players in a way that only the feel of nature can."
Jose Antonio Calvo Ceniceros,2020-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"The saying goes: big perfumes in small bottles. With its special and welcoming proposal, A Short Hike offers exploration, a stimulating environment, calm and a great charisma in its places, characters and situations. A simple-looking game that keeps a caring and loving engine under the hood of its experience of just over two hours, in a journey that many will want to extend and return in more moments, as happens with the special corners of our lives."
Christopher Byrd,2020-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Twee as it is, it’s an achievement that shows how a familiar video game form can be made into something more quiet and unhurried than one might be used to; personally, I’m all for that."
Christian Donlan,2019-08-12T04:00:00.000Z,"A quest to find phone signal leads to a glorious game of exploration and reconnection.

"
Marta Trivi,2019-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"A truly special and intelligent game, one that takes its genre --the often infamous ""walking simulator""-- to new heights."
Kevin Mersereau,2019-07-29T04:00:00.000Z,"A Short Hike is far from perfect, but it absolutely is unique and worth your time. It's also super fucking rad, and I love it. Warts and all. If you're looking for something different, and you don't mind the price of admission, I think this is more than worth the price of entry. It may not be perfect, but life never is, and that's fine and beautiful in its own way."
Tom Baines,2019-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Developer Adam Robinson-Yu began developing A Short Hike when he was feeling burned out working on another project. It's fitting, then, that what began as an act of self-care for the game's developer has blossomed into a welcome respite from the modern world that everyone should experience."
Se Yun Jeon,2021-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,"'Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!' is not much special comparing its free edition which already has shown off a unique experience. However, for fans who want to dig deeper into related stories, it will be like a Christmas gift."
Philip Watson,2021-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! transcends its visuals and becomes its own unique entity, shattering any limitations set by previous entries in the Anime Dating sim genre, and the Horror genre. This game should be experienced by any game enthusiasts that can stomach the heavy subject matter."
Daniel Villagrasa,2021-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,"‎Doki Doki: Literature Club Plus! is a unique game. An experience difficult to describe to those who have not yet played it, but who certainly remain engraved in the retinas of those who play it.‎"
Neal Chandran,2021-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is capable of eliciting strong feelings. It is not always an enjoyable experience, but it is just that: an experience. When I encounter any work that transcends its medium like this, I take special note of it. I am grateful (for lack of a better word) that Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! came my way, and I strongly encourage fellow visual novel aficionados to join the literature club too."
Alejandro Serrador,2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"‎That means that Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! can leave a distinct impression depending on our mood. So much so that a good mental strength, that which serves us to face challenges and complex situations, is imperative if we want to take charge of a proposal that tries to promote ‎‎awareness about mental health,‎‎trying to end prejudices, stereotypes and the stigma that it carries rooted. It asks us to exercise responsibility.‎"
Justin Oneil,2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! starts a bit slow but quickly establishes itself after that as a must-play visual novel. Everything starts all cute and fun but when the dark side of these girls starts coming out, you’ll want to keep playing until the end to see what happens. The game touches on a lot of dark subject matter and it is very much a pure visual novel experience so if you’re someone who doesn’t enjoy those things then this won’t be the game for you. For those who do enjoy this genre you’ll get a multi-hour long experience that will stay with you long after the conclusion."
Danreb Victorio,2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The main thing that makes Doki Doki Literature Club Plus worth anyone’s time is the fact that even four years since its original release, it’s still a shocking and unique experience."
Joseph Repko,2021-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is an excellent re-release that handled its console versions well from a design standpoint. The value and time you find inside will far outweigh its asking price. Just be prepared for some of the moments in the main game as some will shock or make you uncomfortable. It is not advised for children or anyone experiencing mental issues to play this game, so be forewarned."
Matt Sainsbury,2021-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"In the end, Doki Doki Literature Club (and this Plus version) is both a homage and a challenge. It’s a homage in the way it delightfully plays with the dating visual novel genre – sure, it ends up subverting that to horrific effect, but there’s such glee in how it does that that hugely entertaining. On the other hand, it’s also a challenge – a suggestion that the genre can be a bit more reflective, look for ways to approach things differently, and that there is a lot that this genre can do with characterisation and relationship dynamics. The director has been outspoken that the initial seed of Doki Doki Literature Club from his “love/hate” relationship with anime and VNs. There’s much more of the love in there, I think, but developers making games in this genre should certainly play this game to encourage them to think about the structure of their own work from a different angle."
Biagio Etna,2021-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! compared to the free experience on PC, adds either a lot or nothing, depending on your point of view. Pragmatically one could argue the futility of the expense in the face of mostly identical content available for free. However, the point is not this: whether you want to reward the developers after the experience with the free edition, or in case you want to approach the game using its ""improved"" version (despite some limitations), Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! remains a work of extraordinary emotional impact."
Rob Gordon,2021-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall, though, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! shows that the original game has lost none of its power. Those wishing to visit the game again will find its new content deep enough to warrant a replay, and its excellently-told story will still hold weight with newcomers. Go in spoiler free where possible and enjoy its twists and turns."
Jesse Norris,2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"The story is fantastic in this game. Do not investigate it beforehand and you will have one HELL of a time. Developer Team Salvato made something truly special. A game that elevates a genre in a way nothing really had before it, at least for me."
Will Silberman,2021-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is a great addition to the Doki Doki Literature Club! franchise, but I do wish there was just a bit more in the game. For those of you who have already played through DDLC!, you'll have a great time playing through it once again to learn more about our characters' prologues and other secrets embedded in the game itself. You might not be as surprised as you were during your first playthrough of DDLC! back in 2017 (or whenever you played it), but you will be quite intrigued and puzzled as you try and unlock the additional content. Just do your best to avoid spoilers that will be posted online. If you haven't played DDLC! before, DDLCP! is worth your time and an excellent way to get into the franchise. Just know this: This game is not suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed. You've been warned."
Sarah Fields,2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club is one of the most celebrated psychological horror games of recent history, and the Plus release adds enough new content to refresh the experience for veterans who've already experienced the original. Meanwhile, players who have never tried out Team Salvato's original game will find the most complete experience yet from Doki Doki Literature Club Plus."
Luis Alamilla,2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is a great game but remarkably better than its original free PC release. This release on console is shockingly well done for a game that relied so much on it being on PC. Team Salvato did a great job crafting together a virtual machine system that while doesn't completely work as well as just playing on PC, does a good enough job to keep that experience prevalent on consoles. The base story continues to be a chilling and goosebump in goosing story but fails to add anything remarkable with the side story content. While die-hard fans of the series might appreciate the extra lore, I personally didn't feel like it added more that was all that worthwhile. Ultimately, if you don't have a computer with access to the base game, DDLC+ does an exceptional job at bringing the experience to other platforms, it just doesn't add much more to it."
Charlie Kelly,2021-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Near four years since its original release and Doki Doki Literature Club has still stood the test of time thanks to this ‘Plus!’ edition. Where there are some shortcomings in the fact that it takes a little while to get the ball rolling and will be even harder to enter unspoiled, it’s worth it when you consider what’s on offer. Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is a delight. It’s horrific. It’s heartbreaking. But most of all, it’s a wonderful model of how to take the visual novel formula and absolutely turn it on its head. Just be aware, there’s some sadness behind those anime characters’ eyes."
Andrew Thornton,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"A strikingly immediate game that covers dark subjects most titles wouldn’t dream of approaching, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! left my jaw on the floor multiple times. I won’t tell you why, or when. You’ll know when you get there. I was at times happy, sad, and truly horrified. I feel bad even telling you that this game isn’t what it looks like, because even that gives away more than I want you to know going in. This is a game that just keeps opening up as you dig deeper and one that even now I can’t stop thinking about, even if a part of me wishes I could."
Jonathan Laurin,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is a unique and troubling experience. Not everyone should play it as the themes are profoundly serious and mature and the psychological horror part doubles down on that. However, it tells a very compelling story surrounded by an immersive atmosphere. Be ready to come out highly impacted by its ending."
Jenni Lada,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is a great way to revisit a visual novel that made quite a splash. For newcomers, it’s easy to hop into and enjoy, even offering the PC “workarounds.” For people who’ve joined the club before, the extra stories and media are enjoyable. The sole downside is that, with all its accessibility, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is difficult to read on the Switch and has an unfriendly UI."
Samantha Lienhard,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Whether you’re an old fan of Doki Doki Literature Club or someone checking it out for the first time, this new release has something for everyone to enjoy."
Aaron Price,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! brings some much needed quality of life changes to the original game. It also makes it much more accessible to people, no longer being PC only and bringing it to most consoles. If you’re into visual novels, horror, puzzles, or all of the above, this is a nice cheap one to check out."
Stephan Adamus,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is the kind of game that provides experiences unique to the video game medium. It is also the kind of game that pushes the visual novel genre’s boundaries, and serves as an excellent example of what non-video game players might not know they’re missing, if they’re not willing to try different kinds of games. This is a game you will tell everyone about when you’re finished playing it, and at the same time, just like this humble reviewer, you won’t want to share why. For less than $20, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is a highly recommended and very unique gaming experience."
Ricky Berg,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"What it never stops being, though, is interesting. A blend of unapologetic and bittersweet were the lasting flavors, and even if I didn’t savor every moment that brought me to the end it was a refreshingly unique break from reality."
Ed McGlone,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club is among the most memorable, creative, and iconic horror games of the last decade and should be experienced by anyone who is able to safely stomach it. The Plus version of the game effectively adds even more valuable story content to the mix. The writing team was able to show off their skill in these side stories, and the result is a heartwarming experience that makes the Dokis somehow even more lovable than they already were."
Steven Rollins,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is nothing short of a masterpiece and highly recommended to anyone who can handle darker content. It navigates the jump from PC to console well overall, with new mechanics developed to handle gameplay situations that would normally be impossible outside of PC. The extra content, especially the Side Stories, is terrific as well, though it may not be enough to justify a $15 price tag given that the original game is still free on PC."
Kate Gray,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Don't discount Doki Doki Literature Club because it's cute, because it's pink, or because it's an anime dating game - this is one of the most unnerving, effective horror games on the Nintendo Switch to date. The extra content adds nicely to the creeping anxiety and the heartbreaking story, but the Switch version does end up feeling slightly inferior to the PC version, despite fantastic effort on the port. You won't lose anything by playing this version, though - if it's the one you want, go for it!"
Chris White,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is a psychological horror that takes strides in the genre, unsettling and challenging you at every corner."
Kurtis Seid,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is great for existing fans that want to know more about their favorite characters and possibly the deeper universe.
Nirav Gandhi,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The original Doki Doki Literature Club is a phenomenal horror title, but loses a lot of the elements that made it so impressive on its translation to consoles."
Zachary Miller,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club doesn't disappoint as an off-kilter visual novel. If you, like me, tend to avoid this genre, you might consider DDLC as an exception to the rule if you can handle some disturbing content."
Chandler Wood,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club works best if you go into it knowing nothing about it. It's still a visual novel dating sim, and the Plus! version really doubles down on the visual novel aspect, but it breaks the status quo and does the unexpected, making a deeply disturbing psychological horror game out of something that looks cute and adorable on the surface."
José Viana,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Subversive, shocking and even touching, Doki Doki Literature Club Plus brings a definitive package to consoles for all players, fans and new players alike."
Richard Seagrave,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"If you’re a visual novel fan, or at least open to them, you should definitely give Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! a try."
Brett Posner-Ferdman,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club is still a fantastic visual novel, but the Plus version on PS5 struggles to find a purpose besides being a new way to play the original. Existing fans will appreciate some of the new content, such as the side stories and concept art, but locking the content behind multiple playthroughs of a game that loses its appeal after the first time around is a tough pill to swallow. On the other hand, newcomers have no reason to play this version instead of the freeware PC release, since some core PC features were compromised for this port. Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is still a great experience that should be played by anyone remotely interested, but this specific version struggles to be a worthwhile purchase for any fan, new or old."
Lawrence Le,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is both a celebration of visual novels and a deep dive into the potential of interactive fiction. This updated version introduces new content that continues to weaponize the game's mastery over the visual novel format to land even more emotional gut punches.
Carli Velocci,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club Plus is the same game you remember, but with a few small extras that make it all feel more worthwhile."
Hugh Mitchell,2021-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,Spiritfarer is an absolutely gorgeous adventure that tells a heartfelt tale of love and loss.
Scarlet Bell,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer has been one of the hardest games for me to review in recent memory. Presenting an incredibly personal journey supported by a sublime graphical style and soundtrack, it's something I can't get out of my head, and yet struggle to explain just how it captivated me. It is a fantastic experience, and one I wholeheartedly recommend."
Oisin Kuhnke,2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I didn’t hate or dislike my time with the Spiritfarer at all. There were moments of beauty in there, and in some cases there were such honest depictions of death that you don’t see in many other games. But there was so much more that I wish the game did."
Kim Snaith,2021-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Gorgeous, emotional and heartwarming from start to finish, playing Spiritfarer is like sinking into a nice, cosy duvet. It envelops you, and you won’t want to leave. Its slow and steady pace won’t be for everyone, but for those who want a beautiful game to unwind with, it doesn’t get much better than this."
Sina Golabzade,2021-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer hits all the right emotional notes. In a game that is all about death and loss of people that you love, you don’t have to worry about winning or losing, just being a good person and helping others in need is all that is required of you and that's exactly why you should be playing this game."
Heidi Hawes,2020-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,"For the most part, Spiritfarer is a charming and upbeat game, but it covers the themes of death and loss with seriousness and respect. I was genuinely shocked by just how much I came to care about the spirits in my care. Learning about them and helping them move on gave the management sim side of the game have a lot more meaning."
Tom Steel,2020-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,Spiritfarer certainly delivered on representing aspects of different games while most assuredly being its own entity and should be considered a low-key masterpiece.
Michael McCann,2020-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Whether it's down to the sharp, intelligent writing, or fantastic hand-drawn style and animation, Spiritfarer has a charm that could be described as almost Disney-eque… well, maybe that would be true if the first passenger Stella encounters wasn't a chain smoking deer. That charm is without a doubt [i]Spiritfarer[i/]s best asset, and something that many will latch on to consciously or subconsciously when coming to their own judgement on its quality. Yes, it can be slow and repetitive, but that is also part of the point. The 2D take on a life-sim is a path less travelled for the genre, and unique in this instance. It creates an appealing world wherein the developer has gone to great efforts to flesh it out, and make it feel lived in. It all hangs together very nicely, indeed."
Víctor Rosas,2020-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer's journey fulfills from start to finish. No matter how sad its premise is, it is something you must experience, especially for its premise that recognizes that there is a beginning and an end, but what matters is what happens along the way."
Jake Arias,2020-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The prospect of finding another game that cleverly establishes emotion rather than just throwing a sad pianist into the background and bombarding the player with frowny faces was appealing to me, and it lived up to that promise in most respects. Still, I can’t say that I found Spiritfarer particularly touching; the underlying premise of growing attached to a bunch of characters before shepherding them to death’s door (literally) has potential, but in practice, the gameplay is so distractingly repetitive and the writing so wordy that only a third of the passengers made me feel anything but irritation. This is a brilliant 5-hour game that completely loses focus by insisting on lasting for 20+ hours."
Michael Fontanini,2020-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is a fun little game, and it will keep you busy for quite a while. I’ve been playing for over 30 hours, and that’s not 100% completion of everything in the game. It tells a touching tale about death, but does so while not being sappy. The game also features a number of Steam achievements. Overall, it’s still a pretty good game, though. Spiritfarer is available on Steam (and other platforms) for $29.99. Can you help all of the lost souls pass on and reach the end of your own story?"
Mohammad Hossein Jafari,2020-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Do not rush Spiritfarer in any way. Just embrace it. Look at it as an experience that you can enjoy deeply for some weeks. An Indie Video Game that is certainly not for everyone. But If you can accept some down moments, the sadness, the happiness, and weirdness of it, You are going to get 30 hours of meaningful entertainment that is worth your money."
Callum Rakestraw,2020-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer handles its heavy subject matter with care, crafting a story that's equal parts comforting and moving."
Anna Saurman Brown,2020-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game and all the time I spent devouring it. I came into Spiritfarer very excited, and it did not disappoint. It even surprised me with how much I loved it. Spiritfarer has everything relevant to my interests: the afterlife, crafting, crystals, making friends, getting up in other people’s business, fixing (?) problems, and a cat best friend. If you are looking for a beautiful game with some more serious, and sometimes mystical, subject matter, I highly suggest giving Spiritfarer a try."
Juan Lorente,2020-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,Spiritfarer is a management title where its key pieces are narrative and artistic section. A highly recommended adventure that will take you a while to forget.
Evan Norris,2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"A beautiful experience, filled with varied and engaging content, wrapped in gorgeous art and music, and populated with memorable characters and moments that will stay with you for a lifetime."
Abbi Ruggles,2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is a beautiful game in terms of graphics and story, with plenty of tasks to keep you busy from collecting resources, fishing, and building. It's a relaxing experience, and one many people will find comfort in."
Александр Бабулин,2020-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer tries to become a bittersweet balm for loss wounds, but slightly misses the status of a masterpiece without collecting a handful of mini-catharses into one big one at the end."
Arthur Damian,2020-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Regardless of these minor quibbles, Spiritfarer is a journey I wholeheartedly recommend taking, even if management sims are not your thing. The main lessons of accepting loss and the importance of leaving something behind are important to learn. The heavy topics your colleagues discuss with you are also necessary to navigate and leave a lasting gut punch. The title is also wonderfully animated and the music is superb, with its main theme receiving a number of variations throughout the experience that well up deep feelings inside of you. Give it a go if you are ready to ugly cry and smile at the same time!"
Andreas Salmen,2020-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"After everything I've mentioned so far, it's not a surprise that I thoroughly enjoyed Spiritfarer. What initially looked like an eerie combination revealed itself to be a thoughtful, relaxing, and enjoyable journey that deals with loss and caring in heartwarming ways. It's not a flawless masterpiece or a crowd-pleaser, but it knows what it's good at and executes it to an incredibly satisfying degree. If you vaguely enjoy titles like Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon or Stardew Valley, be sure to pick up Spiritfarer."
Paula Moore,2020-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is a positive look at death as all the characters make peace with both their life and death in their own time The characters are charming, all have depth with stories to tell.
While some mini-games may feel tedious the more you do them, there are plenty of other tasks in the game to balance this out.
Playing Spiritfarer at this particular time in the mad and crazy world we live in is something everyone should do. As well as being entertaining and enjoyable to play  Spiritfarer is hopeful, comforting, and positive and certainly big on delivering the ”feels”!"
Hector Ramirez II ,2020-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer wants to convey that, yes, life is beautiful, but death is not the end. Spiritfarer creatively embodies this message in its fun gameplay and moving story that’s more than worth your time."
Leonardo Cidreira,2020-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Some games amuse you, others thrill you and a few deliver key messages that you will carry throughout your life. Spiritfarer manages to do these three things so easily that at the end of his journey it will be impossible not to repeat the journey. The title manages to create a perfect harmony between gameplay and history that will surely please fans of Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. Spiritfarer is, without a doubt, one of the best independent titles of the last decade and the Magnum Opus from Thunder Lotus Games."
Pieter Jasper,2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is a game where death is treated differently than in many other games, which makes this game unique. We’ve been killing people and things in video games for so long, that we’ve stopped to wonder what actually happens after that. In Spiritfarer we learn this, in a colourful and happy world which invites you to be the best Spiritfarer in history.

Who wouldn’t want to leave this world with one of those precious hugs from Stella? One thing is guaranteed. You’ll learn to say goodbye."
Francesco Corica,2020-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"If you want a unique videogame experience and aren't afraid of showing your emotions, Spiritfarer is a title that you should try at least once in your lifetime."
Jenni Lada,2020-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Perhaps the best thing of all is how Spiritfarer builds, grows, and ends."
Kyle Vaughn,2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I can't say that Spiritfarer is a game for everybody, or that it's a perfect game, or even that it's MY perfect game, but I can say that it was a surprise just how much I found myself tangled up in the tales of my friends, and how much each one emotionally resonated with me. It made me consider my relationship with my children, and the duties I have as a father to raise, love, teach, and protect them. I considered my aging and elderly grandmother who lives multiple states away and is due for a visit from me. My thoughts wandered to my own mental health, how I care for myself and whether or not I give myself the attention that I need and deserve. Very seldom does a game come along that so precisely taps into my emotions and causes such a state of reflection. It's difficult not to recommend Spiritfarer to anybody at this point, because it is the most special indie game I've played in a long time."
Daniel Rubio,2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"A beautiful story in a beautiful world. It's simple, but has lots of feeling and imagination to it, and it's full of memorable moments. On the other hand, it can feel a bit of a chore at times, and drags on for a bit too long."
Heather Johnson,2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer has the body of a seafaring exploration game, the mind of a management sim, and the soul of an emotional journey depicting love, loss, and grief. With gorgeous visuals and a soundtrack to match, Spiritfarer is pleasing to the senses while providing a core loop that’s easy to get lost in."
Keenan McCall,2020-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is one of a kind, and well worth anyone’s time."
Alexia Weiss,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The fact Spiritfarer made me think about the meaning of life and death, had me cry in mixed sadness and joy at remembering people I’ve lost, and, more importantly, the memories I’ll always keep of them, is probably the best recommendation I can imagine giving any piece of media."
Raoni Mendes Pinheiro,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is a game about collecting a ton of resources at a frantic pace and exploring a vast map solving quests, but likewise it is also a beautiful bittersweet tale about life and death. The games explore themes like love, affection, goodbyes, pains, insecurities and new beginnings in a way that we don't see much in the world of video games. Best of all, this beautiful story takes place within a legitimately innovative, fun and well-made game. Do not waste time, Spiritfarer is one of the best games of the year for Switch."
Derrick Pittman,2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Spiritfarer is an amazing management indie game to relax to, all while helping players deal, cope, and reflect on death. The game’s colors are awe-inspiring and the soundtrack immediately puts you at ease. Despite the game’s heavy theme of dealing with death, Spiritfarer is a wonderful game."
Nicola Ardron,2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,Spiritfarer is a unique and special game. A management sim that manages to blend its various systems with a poignant and bittersweet look at life and death.
Cody Peterson,2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,Spiritfarer is a deeply personal management game that forces players to care about their passengers and come to terms with the fact that everyone dies.
Jay Kittelson,2019-12-19T00:00:00.000Z,"EXCELLENT - Amazingly detailed Greek architecture world with intentional glitches, haunting music, and a brilliant story make up for one of the best puzzle games to ever grace the Switch or any system."
Jason Brown,2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Croteam, the creators of The Talos Principle, were previously known primarily for their silly (but fun) Serious Sam titles. The Talos Principle shows a remarkable maturity and depth of scope that's perhaps surprising, but in a very good way. It poses interesting questions, allows the player to progress at their own pace - mostly in a non-linear fashion - and is a hugely satisfying piece of game design. Utterly entrancing and highly recommended."
Łukasz Ankudo,2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle is a great puzzle game but number of puzzles, hubs, sub-hubs and sub-sub-hubs will make the game tedious pretty quickly."
Alberto Rocha,2018-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,"Varied and effective puzzle game, which ends up being victim of its own ambition. Too long and somewhat presumptuous, it will work for fans of the genre."
Kamil Dyszewski,2015-11-18T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle, is a game which may bore some to tears, but will serve others with the necessary dose of peace and tranquillity, as the combination of the eerily empty yet beautifully charming locations with the peaceful and calming soundtrack, will surely serve most with exactly what they need when taking a break from the big AAA action games of today."
Adam J. Ramsey,2015-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle: Deluxe Edition offers a huge amount of quality, intelligent gameplay for sci-fi fans and puzzle goers alike. Although it tries a little too hard at times, the title's narrative is generally rich and compelling – and there's enough side content available to keep even the most curious of androids busy for hours at a time. If you're in the market for a fulfilling, well-paced puzzler on the PS4, look no further than this one."
Robert Workman,2015-11-02T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle has made an effective jump from PC to PlayStation 4, thanks to the addition of expansion levels and a presentation that really makes use of the hardware at hand. While it's not quite a perfect transition, it remains a very applicable one, as the level design and snowballing level design continue to keep their momentum. Even if you're not entirely a fan of first-person games, Talos is worth a look, if only for the story alone."
Tom Sykes,2015-10-15T04:00:00.000Z,"With its relaxing atmosphere, pretty environments and interesting theological dilemma, The Talos Principle is PS4's best puzzler to date."
Eric Hall,2015-10-12T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle: Deluxe Edition is unlike anything else out there. The expertly crafted puzzles will give any gamer a mental workout, while the humanity-questioning storyline is the type of philosophical tale that has been sorely lacking in the current gaming landscape. "
Lou Sytsma,2015-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,"Action junkies will probably come away underwhelmed but if you are looking for a change of pace in your game playing regime this thoughtful, Carl Sagan Cosmos-like experience is a wonderful candidate to consider."
Steven Messner,2015-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,"While the sweetest fruits will be saved for those with an appreciation of philosophy and history, the elation of solving a puzzle that you spent an evening trying to crack is a reward that anyone can enjoy."
Jeb Haught,2015-10-09T04:00:00.000Z,"I didn't expect a video game to have deep philosophical questions that I pondered long after each session, and I appreciate how it adds the kind of depth seldom seen in games. It's also very cool to play a non-combat game that keeps me interested for hours at a time. The Talos Principle: Deluxe Edition doesn't offer any new content to entice people who played the PC version, but I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't."
David Roberts,2015-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,"While some graphical issues keep the PS4 version from matching its PC counterpart, The Talos Principle remains one of the most interesting, intelligent, and inspiring video games ever made. Absolutely essential gaming."
Paulmichael Contreras,2015-10-08T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle may be one of the best puzzle games of the year. Sure, it starts out pretty slowly, the first dozen or so of the game's 120+ puzzles are laughably easy, and the controls may be a little awkward, but these are minor flaws in the bigger scheme of things. There's an entertaining and thoughtful story about not just humanity, but what it means to be alive. If you want to flex your brain and start thinking about time in a Echoshift/Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time way, as well as wax philosophical with a computer terminal, The Talos Principle will keep you entertained for quite some time."
Dalton Cooper,2015-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle plays like a marriage between Portal and a game from the 'walking simulator' genre, complete with an intriguing narrative and challenging puzzles."
Randy Kalista,2015-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle is a meaningful exercise. Sure, I worked out my brain with some good old fashioned puzzle solving. But the real workout began when I started sweating questions of why-am-I-here existence, of what constitutes consciousness—and whether the end is really the end, or if it's really the beginning, or if it's somewhere along the way."
Bob Mackey,2015-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,"If you love and miss the Portal series, it's time to celebrate: The Talos Principle has all the first-person puzzles you've been craving, wrapped in an extremely thoughtful package. Don't be surprised if you feel legitimately smarter after reaching the end of its 100-plus puzzles."
Justin Celani,2015-10-07T04:00:00.000Z,"There are a few performance issues here on console but that aside Talos Principal is an excellent puzzle based game that keeps players engaged and perplexed, a winning combination all around in my book."
James Cunningham,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle: Deluxe Edition is a fantastic package of two great first-person puzzlers.  It's basically identical to the PC version, so if you've got those already there's not much need to double-dip, but otherwise it's a must-own."
Mikhail Madnani,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle surprised me in almost every way, and it's one of the best puzzle games in recent years."
Will Robinson,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,"One of the most intellectually stimulating experiences on PS4, with imaginative puzzles, fantastic atmosphere and a brilliant expansion that builds tremendously on the core game."
Conrad Reyners,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,The Talos Principle on PS4 lives up to the hype of its PC cousin. It's a genre masterpiece that anyone with the slightest interest in puzzles or philosophy should pick up as a matter of priority.
Stephanie Carmichael,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,"At the core of The Talos Principle is the startling idea that man is not so different from machine, and that our truest purpose lies in the contributions we leave for our children, and our children's children. Though we die, our legacy remains through them, and through what our small actions help them accomplish, even in the face of total destruction."
Martin Segarra,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle is a great thought-provoking puzzler which deals with the existential questions of mankind while delivering an enjoyable and satisfying adventure. It may get cumbersome and tedious at times, but it's worth it just for being unlike anything else out there"
Cory Wells,2015-10-06T04:00:00.000Z,"The core gameplay of Talos feels like a distant cousin to the Portal series. While the game is absolutely beautiful and challenging, it will feel like there is a lot to accomplish at first. But once you start progressing through the game, you will pick up on the aspect that it is not as open as you originally perceived. The emotion the game creates is fantastic, but you might not like or understand the story."
Jordan Hurst,2015-07-06T04:00:00.000Z,"This is a title for anyone who has ever looked at the ocean or the night sky and been stunned by the unfathomable vastness of the universe and the mystery of the human condition. Hopefully, that's everyone."
Jonathan Gordon,2015-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,Great puzzle design combined with an ambitious story
Autumn Fish,2015-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,The Talos Principle is a brilliant puzzle game with story and gameplay elements that blend remarkably well.
Brian Dumlao,2015-01-28T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle can easily be called the next big puzzle game in the same vein as Portal. The story fosters some thoughtful discussion and sticks with you. The puzzles are clever and have a natural progression in difficulty, and the tools make them fun, even if none are completely new to the genre. The presentation is beautiful, and the game's overall length means you'll spend quite a bit of time on your initial playthrough. In a nutshell, you must pick up The Talos Principle."
Mukul Gupta,2015-01-23T05:00:00.000Z,"As puzzlers come, The Talos Principle is certainly the cream of the crop and easily deserves any praise that can be laid at its doorstep. The puzzles can be tricky but are always intuitive, asking questions of you and driving you through the environment.  Even the graphics, despite their seemingly conflicting styles, are good enough to draw you in. It's bizarre that the same team who brought us something like Serious Sam could deliver some so cerebral and philosophical, but the team has achieved here is the ultimate collection of logical conundrums."
James Marshall,2015-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,The Talos Principle will make you feel confounded but in that wonderful way that precludes an epiphany. You'll leave each session feeling genuinely smarter - and perhaps a little rebellious to boot.
Michael Thomsen,2015-01-13T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle is rarely capable of answering the questions for which it makes you want answers. But in leaving enough space to wonder, it lets players name the questions in their own terms, a freedom that only leads back into a cell, dependent on language from long-forgotten generations, like computer code we're no longer conscious of running but can't seem to escape."
Paul King,2015-01-11T05:00:00.000Z,This narrative distance and the slow difficulty curve both point to the same thing: an over-reluctance to lose or alienate an audience unwilling to engage with philosophical thought or difficult puzzles. But that belies the ideal audience for a philosophical puzzle game: an audience willing to try.
Anthony John Agnello,2015-01-07T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle is what it is, though, and inflexible puzzles don't dim the inquisitive light shining inside this game. Croteam has made something rewarding and ultimately knowable but also something that inspires reflection on what isn't."
Andrei Dobra,2014-12-26T05:00:00.000Z,"The Talos Principle is a delightful puzzle experience that spurs the curiosity of players both in terms of solutions to the challenges and to the philosophical nature of our existence. It's certainly worth it to go through the game as there are just a few downsides, from the freezes to the slightly repetitive solutions or the jump scares caused by unnoticed obstacles."
Jed Pressgrove,2014-12-23T05:00:00.000Z,"While The Shivah also explores the reconciliation of faith and practicality, its corny climax can't match The Talos Principle's matter-of-fact ending, which argues that our chosen perspective will limit what we discover in one way or another. Thank God the puzzles are worth it."
David Will,2014-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,"Not content with merely being a fairly impressive piece of writing and first-person puzzle design, The Talos Principle sets out to expand your horizons, and will most likely succeed. Croteam's foray into territory beyond absurd, large-scale first-person shooters is not without faults, but it proves without a doubt that they aren't the one-trick pony you thought they were."
Adam Standing,2014-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,"It's an experience that truly stretched different parts of my mind in more satisfying way than Portal. Though the puzzles frustrate at times, most are put together thoughtfully and in a simple enough way that you can go away and figure it out on paper if you need to (I needed to, frequently)."
Lawrence Le,2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,Doki Doki Literature Club Plus! is both a celebration of visual novels and a deep dive into the potential of interactive fiction. This updated version introduces new content that continues to weaponize the game's mastery over the visual novel format to land even more emotional gut punches.
Billy Clarke,2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club is a mind boggling and hard hitting horror game that takes tried and tested formulas of both visual novels and dating sims and turns them on their heads. The themes and story pack a punch, and stayed with me long after I had finished playing. It may require commitment from some to get through but the reward for those who stick it is more than worth it"
Mario Petillo,2018-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club is a visual novel that clearly does not open to a vast audience and that does not appear as the title that everyone will love. It is important to take into account the strong narrative component, which is different from what we are used to in the mainstream videogame: the visual novel urges us to sit down - or lay down, as you prefer - and read, read and read again, keeping the same image static in the background."
Robert Fenner,2017-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,"Funny, sad, and with the sharpest teeth, Doki Doki Literature Club is one of the most pleasant surprises of 2017."
Chris Davis,2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,"Doki Doki Literature Club is free and I feel slightly uncomfortable being so critical of it. However, it also demands over four hours of your time. We all have backlogs of games we’ve already payed for and yet haven’t found the time to play. Go and play one of them instead. Doki Doki Literature Club isn’t worth your time."
William Main,2017-10-19T04:00:00.000Z,"Team Salvato have created an interesting and very creative title. A visual novel's UI is often fairly simple, but the player is offered more control than they may first realise."
Andrew Hayward,2018-07-17T04:00:00.000Z,"After two and a half years of steady play, it's those little thrills that keep me coming back."
Alberto Lloret,2018-01-01T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League arrived at Nintendo Switch last year, capturing all the fun, tight controls and gameplay from the previous versions, not without losing on the way part of its visual power (effects and textures are a little bit lower here). It's physical release an insane amount of content, although not all the DLC its included (neither via voucher)."
Brandin Tyrrel,2017-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,Rocket League's colorfully absurd cars-playing-sports concept works so well because the energy of its arcadey gameplay meshes with its deep team-based strategy and variety of modes. It's exceedingly rare to find a multiplayer game that's welcoming and approachable for new players and so intricate that the best players can earn a living by mastering its depths. Rocket League is a golden example of turning a good idea into something truly amazing.
Davide Mancini,2017-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Psyonix brings to Nintendo Switch all the flawless plesure of Rocket League in 60 fps, despite a visual downgrade and the absence of analogic triggers. If you want to play for fun only (with no ""pro"" velleity), this is the version you should consider to buy."
Craig Shields,2017-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is an absolute must on the Switch. Its pick-up-and-play nature shines through on Nintendo’s portable console that even minor technical drawbacks can’t dampen. If you own a Switch, you need to get Rocket League."
Kaisernik,2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,Rocket League is an insanely fun game and absolutely worth its price. It's quite possible that its pricetag is lower simply due to the available unintrusive further monetization options. This is of course a good thing for the budget-orientated gamer.
Henrique Pereira,2017-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League fits on the Nintendo Switch without any major issues but most importantly, it brings all the magnificent multiplayer experiences with it. Thanks to an outstanding online functionality and to the wide and varied multiplayer possibilities, Rocket League marks its territory and claims the title of one of the best multiplayer experiences on the Nintendo Switch."
Anders Wollner,2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is one of the most addictive multiplayer game you will ever play, with deep mechanics and a great community. The Switch version works really well."
Bryan Calhoun,2017-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League on the Switch is like winning an all expenses paid vacation to Florida. Yes, it's Florida, but you still won a free vacation."
Alan Jones,2017-11-27T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is fast, fun, frantic, and borderline addictive. It is a must-buy for anyone after that competitive esport experience on Nintendo Switch."
Harrison Milfeld,2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,"Aside from a few online connectivity hiccups and some small graphical shortcomings, Rocket League is still a fun and joyful experience to behold. It's addictive and chaotic nature alone make it a must-own for Switch owners who want to get their next multiplayer fix."
Az Elias,2017-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is showing no signs of slowing down, and why should it?"
Jared Rosenberg,2017-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,"I've been playing quick matches while waiting for the NYC subway and during my lunch break at work. The one major negative is the resolution in undocked mode. I personally haven't felt like it's hindered a match for me, but it's still pretty annoying. Nonetheless, there's endless amounts of fun to be had with Rocket League and even with some graphical shortcomings it's still a must buy on the Switch."
Paul Murphy,2017-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,"It's Rocket League, and it's incredibly entertaining. Static screens do not do this game justice; yes it's a little rough visually but you will hardly notice because you will be having so much fun. It's brilliant. If you love fun, football and/or racing you'll love this."
Greg Bargas,2017-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,"The Nintendo Switch version of Rocket League is a worthy port. It is welcomed, fun, and brings Switch owner's into the light. Now excuse me while I recline and match wits in my Paladin."
Aureliano Carvajal,2017-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,Don't let the graphical downgrade distance you from a great experience. Rocket League on the go is as fun and addictive in Switch as in any other platform. One of the best multiplayer games in the Nintendo Switch.
Ryan Janes,2017-11-21T05:00:00.000Z,"When all is said and done, Rocket League on Switch is a great version of the game. It manages to deliver the same addictive experience as its more powerful siblings whether playing docked or handheld and, even though graphically it may not be as strong, this is an easy recommendation for any Switch owner."
Paul Collett,2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,Rocket League is another must-have title to add to the growing list of great games you need in your Switch collection.
Michael Goroff,2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,"The formula that has kept Rocket League fresh translates exceedingly well to Nintendo's hybrid system, whether docked or portable. Less polished visuals are a small price to pay to be able to play Rocket League anytime, anywhere, at a performance level that never quits, though the notable jaggies and (through no fault of its own) a hindered party system mean that the Switch version isn't the most competitive version of the game."
Khurram Imtiaz,2017-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League for the Nintendo Switch manages to successfully capture all of the craziness of the game into a portable, but it is not a perfect port. The visuals take a hit and there are some minor issues that need to be ironed out."
Miikka Lehtonen,2017-11-19T05:00:00.000Z,"""Doesn't benefit from Switch's online infrastructure."""
Álvaro Giménez,2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League on Nintendo Switch is an amazing experience and we can carry our game wherever we want. Even though its graphics could be better when in portable mode, this game means hours and hours of entertainment."
Dave Aubrey,2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is a great, exciting game, and none of that is lost on Switch, even if it is a less pretty version of the game. If you want a Rocket League experience you can take on the go, this is the perfect way."
Jordan Ramée,2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League on Switch is everything that Rocket League has to offer, with added portability. Some new battle cars help differentiate this port from other versions of the game, but, honestly, Rocket League on Switch would still be fantastic without them."
Nick Gillham,2017-11-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League on Switch is a bit like Sloth from The Goonies, it's ugly, but it's lovable and gets the job done."
Paul Tamburro,2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is a fast, frenetic and addictive game, and playing it while on the move ensures that you won't feel compelled to put it down until your Switch's battery runs out."
Stefan L,2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,The most important thing about Rocket League on Nintendo Switch is that it feels like Rocket League.
Nazih Fares,2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,"If you need a simple and fun game, playable with friends whether at home or online and offering an original formula, Rocket League is a perfect pick on Nintendo Switch as long as you are not nitpicky about graphics. This weird and crazy merge between two easy theme - football and driving game - is a wonderful demonstration that simple ideas, when well treated, can yield excellent games. The games will flow, with good laughs, and award all hardcore gamers who will invest time to move forward and do good deeds. It lacks a bit of content and variety in the game modes, as well as a noticeable graphical difference between all four platforms, but I do believe the developers Psyonix will fix this easily."
Juan García,2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,The same excellent game but a little bit more ugly yet more portable.
Damien McFerran,2017-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,"One of modern gaming's true multiplayer success stories, Rocket League is an essential addition to the Switch's striking year-one library. Analyse every screenshot and video and yes, you'll spot visual downgrades when compared to the other console editions, but what's key here is that the spirit of the game has been transferred perfectly, with the added benefit of portable play which opens up the chance to host local matches with your Switch owning mates wherever and whenever you fancy. Developer Panic Button has done an utterly fantastic job with this port, but technical wizardry aside, what really matters is that the core game is so addictive, so compelling, so enjoyable and – perhaps above all else – so deep. Don't let anyone tell you that Rocket League is simplistic or lacks longevity; the vibrant community that has grown up around Psyonix's masterpiece renders that viewpoint wholly incorrect. This is a game that rewards skilful play and perseverance, and new tactics and strategies seem to flow from each and every match you partake in. Only the occasional network niggle throws shade on this otherwise sublime release; the Switch has yet another must-have release to add to its awe-inspiring 2017 pile."
Shaun Munro,2017-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League Switch may not be the definitive version of Psyonix’s all-timer car sports game, but it just might represent the most fun and accessible way to play it. Seriously, what are you even waiting for?"
Peter Brown,2017-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,Rocket League survives its conversion to Switch with minimal wear and tear.
Greg Hart,2017-03-28T04:00:00.000Z,"One of the tried and true methods for creating novelty lies in taking two separate things people love, and mashing them together. The results can fluctuate, and are often self-indulgent, but they always seem to tickle a certain fascination: Doctor Who in Star Trek, some alcohol in your coffee, and of course, countless Taco Bell experiments. For gamers, one need only peruse through the endless pages of Steam to see a variety of genre crossovers. Play a hero in your tower defense, shoot down hordes of enemies as you strategize in your RTS, and of course, voxel everything. However, it's rare that inspiration and execution come together as perfectly as they have in Psyonix's driving/soccer hybrid Rocket League.  Overall, Rocket League nails the digital sport, creating a game where finesse, practice, and strategy coalesce into an experience that's accessible, deep, and enjoyable."
Daniel Palička,2017-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is a perfect addition to the sports and racing genre. Amusing gameplay with a variety of modes is complemented by a sophisticated tutorial, ideally suited to newcomers, along with the tremendous possibilities to customize your car."
Paul Shemmell,2016-09-07T04:00:00.000Z,"As much fun as an FA Cup Final, with rocket propelled cars."
Eddie Stubbington,2016-07-28T04:00:00.000Z,"A very unique game with loads of content, paid and free"
Wyzzlex,2016-05-06T04:00:00.000Z,"Rocket League is easy to learn but hard to master. Even after dozends of hours you'll still find ways to improve your play style. Fair matchmaking, regular updates with new items, maps and gameplay changes all combine to a great gaming experience - especially with friends!"
Amirhossein Dehnavi,2016-03-23T04:00:00.000Z,Rocket League is one of the Best Multiplayer experience you can found and Psyonix Prove that the idea of Playing Soccer with Cars is absolutely amazing.
Wh1plash96,2016-03-07T05:00:00.000Z,"If you're looking for a game to relax and have fun with your friends/girlfriend/family, I would suggest Rocket League. For $19.99, you cannot go wrong with this game!"
Nate Kiernan,2017-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Rise never reconciles where the line between archeology and blatant theft actually lies. Between her many firefights, Lara spends most of her time picking through garbage, opening chests, and murdering endangered species, all in the name of exploration. But as is always the case with colonialism, what Lara is after is not really answers or the objects themselves, it’s money for a new gun upgrade and a bigger bag for furs."
Charl den Dulk,2016-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,"There are also side missions scattered throughout the different locations, but they aren't all that extraordinary, to begin with. They will have you shooting down drones, fetching supplies, exploring certain locations and bringing back items. So while the games story is lacking and acts only as window dressing for the games set pieces and Lara has no real character to speak of not to mention the lack of memorable supporting cast members in the game. I can still highly recommend the game as it is an excellent polished port and the DLC will keep you busy for hours. Thoroughly enjoyable, with a surprisingly long campaign which vastly improves on every single aspect that we got in the first game. If you haven't already, go pick it up and play it now!"
Liam Croft,2016-10-13T04:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is the complete package for both newcomers and series veterans. Barring some wonky gunplay, the base game is superb, with its sublime exploratory mechanics, wonderful semi-open world hubs that deliver tons of side content, and sensational graphics. Lara's Nightmare does feel like a bit of a throwaway, but Blood Ties and the Baba Yaga DLC are more than worth your time if you want to stray away from the main adventure. Lara Croft is back where she belongs, and you owe it to yourself to join the 20 year celebration and get back to some tomb raiding."
Leo Stevenson,2016-10-11T04:00:00.000Z,"If you already own Rise on Xbox One or PC, there's no reason to buy it again. The new content is absolute crap and neither the additional skins, nor the included DLC warrant buying this game again. That being said, the core game remains excellent in almost every way; if you're solely a PS4 owner, now is your time to experience the next chapter in Lara's epic tail."
Gianluca Loggia,2016-10-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider on PS4 today is as beautiful as it was on Xbox One 12 months ago. Plus, the 20 Year Celebration Edition is plenty of contents to explore and play."
,,
Jack Gash,2016-07-10T04:00:00.000Z,Rise of The Tomb Raider is a very good sequel that improves a lot of the issues present in the original but doesn't completely fix them. While definitely flawed in some areas it is undeniably fun and an incredibly strong entry in the franchise.
Steve Murray,2016-04-12T04:00:00.000Z,"Your enjoyment of Rise of the Tomb Raider will be entirely tied to whether you're more interested in a game's story or its gameplay. If you're looking to be in your own interactive action movie, you're going to absolutely love ROTTR. If you want characters and story, then you should go back to Tomb Raider 2013 if you haven't already played it."
Amirhossein Dehnavi,2016-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is the Best in its Series. With its amazing story and Gorgeous world to explore, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a Must Play for adventures Seekers."
Andrei Dobra,2016-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider successfully reiterates the success of its predecessor by updating and upgrading quite a few different things, like combat, crafting, or RPG mechanics, while improving the environmental design and the general flow of the campaign. There are very few downsides, and no matter if you were a longtime fan or not, you can have plenty of intense fun with Lara's latest adventures."
Jamie Parry-Bruce,2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,The thing that really stands out about Rise of the Tomb Raider is that you care about the characters at all
Michal Grác,2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,Lara Croft proves once again that she's a real badass and even after years on a gaming market she has still plenty to say. Rise of the Tomb Raider is a beautiful action adventure game.
Marcus Estrada,2016-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,The game used in this review was a digital copy supplied by Square Enix.
Tim McDonald,2016-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,"A solid, lengthy, entertaining romp across both tombs and not-tombs, with a quality PC port. If you want more Tomb Raider 2013, this offers improvements on most of that game's mechanics and is unlikely to disappoint."
Jason Hidalgo,2016-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is a solid followup to the series' reboot, offering a nice mix of adventuring, puzzle platforming and action in a pretty-looking setting. Admittedly, it doesn't really break any new ground but it's a very polished rendition of the genre that continues the story of everyone's favorite Croft. If you're a fan of the reboot or never tried it but love the classic games in the series, Rise of the Tomb Raider is one game you'll want to climb onto."
Mary Billington,2016-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,My time with Rise of the Tomb Raider is incredible so far.
Jonathan Gordon,2016-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,A fun adventure hampered by a lack of vision
Richard Seagrave,2015-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,"It may feel familiar, but it's a warm and welcoming kind of familiar"
Levi van Tine,2015-12-13T05:00:00.000Z,"'Rise of the Tomb Raider' is a slightly larger, slightly better version of the last game. The devs have played it safe in terms of adding new mechanics and content, opting for what has worked in the past. It still works, of that there is no doubt - 'Rise of the Tomb Raider' is a great game and should be played by any action fan. It could have been more, but is far better than most games of its ilk."
Austin Adamson,2015-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of the strongest, most entertaining, single-player experiences of 2015."
Evan Norris,2015-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,"While the final act bogs down in firefights, the game, for the most part, juggles physical and mental challenges successfully."
Ed McGlone,2015-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is a deeper and more polished version of its predecessor. It offers similar action-adventure thrills as its competition such as Uncharted but goes beyond that as well. Its open and explorable hub areas that are filled with optional tombs and hunting and gathering crafting options, give it more depth than other games in its genre."
Bradley Marsh,2015-11-16T05:00:00.000Z,An improvement of 2013's release in every way and one of the best games of 2015.

Phil Hornshaw,2015-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,Rise of the Tomb Raider is the best blockbuster game of 2015.
Mike Splechta,2015-11-14T05:00:00.000Z,"If you've enjoyed Crystal Dynamics' reboot, then chances are you'll love Rise of the Tomb Raider that much more. Lara's latest adventure is bigger and better in nearly every way. The settings and environments are bigger, the tombs are plentiful, the combat is exciting and Lara herself is once again brought to life thanks to Camilla Luddington's fantastic performance."
Matt Paprocki,2015-11-13T05:00:00.000Z,"Rise of the Tomb Raider is not only essential, it's poised to be endearing snapshot of America's battle over religious freedoms."
Robert Workman,2015-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,"The game as a whole is a wonderful experience, even surpassing the original adventure that put Lara back on the map in 2013. It's that kind of sequel that deserves your utmost appreciation – kind of like a treasure in itself."
Jim Sterling,2015-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,"Thankfully, the main game itself is easily worth the price of admission. A gripping story in spite of its cliches, with an expanded serving of the gameplay that made Tomb Raider such a wild ride, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a damn fine sequel that does everything a sequel needs to do. What's more, it truly cements Lara's new adventures as a series with a solid future, and I'm excited to see where Croft and Trinity go next."
Liam Martin,2015-11-11T05:00:00.000Z,"The PS4 may be way ahead of the Xbox One in terms of sales, but in Rise of the Tomb Raider, Microsoft finally has something to brag about. As a timed Xbox exclusive, PlayStation owners will be able to get their hands on the Tomb Raider sequel eventually. But the bad news is they'll have to wait a whole year, until December 2016. Over to you, Nathan Drake - you really do have a mountain to climb.​"

Clinton Bowman-Christie,2015-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,"I don't know about you, but Rise of the Tomb Raider, while not a complete masterpiece, is pretty damn close to being one in the Action-Adventure genre."
Spencer Campbell,2015-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,"Whether you're in the mood for stealth or all-out action, Rise of the Tomb Raider has got you covered, but when it comes time to put down the guns and start talking, the game screeches to a halt. Even so, it's hard to deny what a blast it is to slip into Lara's shoes once more."
Ozzie Mejia,2015-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,"Now that Lara Croft's origin story is out of the way, does she blossom into the hardened explorer that's made her such an icon in Rise of the Tomb Raider?"
Ben Allan,2015-11-10T05:00:00.000Z,Rise of the Tomb Raider is a big-budget title that delivers a breathtaking adventure with all the trimmings.
Ryan Jones,2022-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 packs in a number of new features such as the Data Hub, an expanded Transfer Deadline Day and new Staff Meetings which all help to improve the immersion of the life as a head coach. These new additions result in one of the best entries in the series yet, although owners of FM21 may want to hold off until next season if you want more than just an incremental upgrade."
Kevin Groves,2021-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Small meaningful improvements to nearly every aspect of the game is where you want to be as a gaming company, regardless of the genre, and Sports Interactive delivers with Football Manager 2022."
Matthew Buzzi,2021-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"No single release from an annualized franchise revolutionizes the gameplay experience, but Football Manager 2022 delivers visual and mechanical improvements in multiple areas, making it the best series entry yet."
Javier Gutierrez Bassols,2021-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,"‎In short, a good game that fulfills what it promises, but that will fall short for those who have been achieving their dreams in past editions on computers for some time.‎"
Eric Fernández,2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"FM22 will consume hundreds of hours as you try to create the perfect team and tactics. Newcomers to the series will find a simulator with hundreds of variables to master, but veterans may miss a little more innovation and depth."
Alix Dulac,2021-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is no exception to the rule established by its long line: rule without sharing. This is exactly what the Sports Interactive game will do this season, as much by the absence of competition as by an impeccable mastery of its subject, reinforced by new features more likely to improve playing comfort. The Covid has certainly played, but this edition still lacks major changes to mark the occasion. When it comes to being the indisputable owner of your Steam library, football fan, you know the answer."
Oguz Erdogan,2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 has gone from being a bit unbeatable to the convenience of being unbeatable, but it would be unfair to ignore the great improvements they have made. If you're addicted to this species, there's little chance you won't like it. If you are going to start for the first time, it is worth looking at the older versions first."
Rich Edmonds,2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager may be an annual release, but Sports Interactive continues to find ways to improve the best footy management sim out there. This is the installment to get back into the swing of things."
Tom Hoggins,2021-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,The latest in Sports Interactive's all-consuming management sim is the toughest and deepest trip to the dugout yet
Rick Lane,2021-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,"It may not be a radical change, but it's still one of the best management experiences around."
Gianluca Arena,2021-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 marks a slow transition to a better game, and the third and final version next year promises to be even more exciting. This is is as good as always, but the new elements are less than we would have liked."
Shubhankar Parijat,2021-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 richest, most nuanced, and most dangerously addictive iteration of Sports Interactive's yearly sim series yet."
Ernesto Olicón,2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 manages to succesfully represent the complexity of soccer, but at the same time, it offers an accesible experience that anyone can enjoy. Hardcore fans will be thankful for all the additions, and newcomers will feel welcomed."
Cosmin Vasile,2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is a great take on the most popular sport of the world. It provides ways for both casual and obsessive fans to get more involved with their favorite club or almost any other team they want. The new animation system changes the experience quite a lot, both visually and tactically. Some transfer action might feel a little unreal and the game still generates new players that sometimes make little sense. But this is a solid game with a lot of options and plenty of incredible moments."
Euyen Esquefa Pons,2021-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is the undisputed king of sports managers. Perhaps this delivery sins of being too continuous and does not offer excessive news, but it is still an excellent game -and a franchise-."
Jake Su,2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"With some truly remarkable additions and a few missteps along the way, Football Manager 2022 continues the series’ fine form for yet another year."
Gabriele Barducci,2021-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is the kind of game that doesn't really need to change. Even if there's no revolution mechanics wise, many aspects show a finer attention to detail, and there are some new factors to consider. A more complete and more fun game, that every fan of the franchise is sure to enjoy."
James Law,2021-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"It's a must-play, the perfect next step for existing FM fanatics, and the ideal place to start if you've never dipped your toe in the deep end of management simulations. You'll be able to get started easily and stop playing after just one more game. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to lose 6-1 to Liverpool in a failed attempt to implement a Gegenpress at Reading FC."
Matúš Štrba,2021-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 si the most complex football experience ever with a lot of improvemenets, but some bugs as well."
Aran Suddi,2021-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is a good iterative step with the improvement of the matchday engine and the addition of the data hub. The data hub especially, as well as regular staff meetings, bring the franchise another step closer to the full management experience."
Chris Wray,2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is yet another improvement on the long-running series, one that brings the beautiful game to life more than ever before and recreates both the small and large moments that make the sport so engaging. The options are near limitless, and the game puts even more at your fingertips, from the Data Hub to improved staff meetings, all adding onto a revamped match engine. This is the closest Sports Interactive has come to perfection, with only small elements feeling aged and needing polishing."
Seungjin Kang,2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,The evolution of animation and the new match engine have redrawn the stagnant FM series.
Ashley Hobley,2021-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,Football Manager 2022 is the best in the franchise so far and makes sure that it’ll continue to sit at the top of the (small) mountain of sports management games.
Ford James,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2021 was the best entry in the series for some time, and it’s safe to say that Football Manager 2022 continues that trend, by building upon the huge leaps it took last year. The improvements this time around aren’t quite as groundbreaking as last time because they’re a little more subtle and less on-the-nose, but they’re there nevertheless, meaning it is a brilliant time to be a Football Manager player. I just wish I didn’t play quite so much of the last instalment, because I’m not quite ready to start again after leaving behind my beloved Oxford United squad just a few weeks ago."
Bob van der Laan,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 brings the management experience to the next level. With the addition of the extensive transfer windows and the Data Hub, the game feels even more realistic and you want to keep playing it for as long as possible."
Curtis Russell,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is a strategy game that continues to improve with more in-depth features that helps you succeed on the virtual pitch. The new Data Hub brings a more profound analysis system to the game that helps you pick the best line-ups on match day. The endless hours of tinkering with my club’s tactics, transfers, squad, and staff have yielded meaningful results in my club’s progression. And I still have many hours of fun ahead of me with one of the best sports simulators."
Paul Tamburro,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"All in all, Football Manager 2022 is another sublime sports simulation. It once again proves that you can enjoy football games without directly controlling the players. Its new additions add to an experience already brimming with depth, and the refinement of the gameplay style means that you’ll struggle not to lose yourself within Sports Interactive’s digital training ground. Its proficiency on even the oldest of hardware means there’s really no excuse not to dive in. This is Football Manager at its best, the virtual equivalent of a top-corner goal."
Álvaro Hernandez,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,‎Football Manager gives a new blow on the table with a delivery full of novelties that do nothing but improve an experience that already borders on perfection and that each delivery is more and more demanding.‎
Raffaello Rusconi,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"At a superficial glance Football Manager 2022 might seem like little more than just an update: the new chapter of Sports Interactive's football management simulation is much more. That one is delivered to the annals is probably not the best Football Manager in the thirty-year history of the series, but a good episode yes."
Jay Jaffa,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Sports Interactive have done it again. The match engine roars into the modern era with significant and overdue AI tweaks, and whilst there are still some stale features the game feels deeper and easier to navigate than ever."
Davide Mancini,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is a chapter of consolidation, which capitalizes on last year's revolution. Sports Interactive has worked hard to improve the game engine even more, with brilliant animations and a brand new AI, which has a strong impact on certain game situations, such as pressing and occupying half spaces. The introduction of the Data Hub and small changes to the interface makes Football Manager 2022 the umpteenth excellent chapter of the series, which for the occasion also lands on Xbox Game Pass."
Peter Taylor,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Over the years I've had a love/hate relationship with Football Manager. Some years I can't put it down, others I can barely make it through a season. Football Manager 2022 is a cracking entry in the series and has added plenty to make it feel fresh when compared to previous years, the data hub being the cream of the crop."
Chris White,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 is about as close to the real thing as you can get, with some nice improvements that make it the ultimate experience."
Jordan Forward,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"With more tools at your disposal than ever, this is a rich, realistic management simulation that delivers thrills both on and off the pitch."
Chris Tapsell,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Football Manager 2022 ramps up the emphasis on the modernness of today's game. It's the most accurate, most joyfully compulsive entry yet."
Matt Killeen,2021-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,The veteran playmaker is still banging them in and deserves that new contract.
Jason Flatt,2020-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"If you have not experienced The Messenger yet, there is no better time than now. Its unique and witty take on a tried and true genre is challenging and fun with nice replayability. Never frustrating and always asking you to improve your platforming abilities, the 2D platformer is one of the best of recent years."
Jake Su,2019-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,"An instant classic, The Messenger is one you will not want to miss."
Danial Dehghani,2019-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,It seems as if it is impossible to break away from this game. Don't even think about ignoring the magic of messenger!
Justin Prinsloo,2019-04-20T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a unique and enjoyable 2D platformer with a strong personality and exciting gameplay, and its fine-tuned appearance on the PS4 is a welcome one. The first half of the game is worthy of unfettered praise, but the experience takes a hefty blow at the halfway point from a failed attempt at expanding the scope. This aside, it remains a lovingly conceived game and is well worth playing through on this basis, but its flaws prevent it from going down as a true classic. In light of the fact that this is the first game by Sabotage, it's fair to say that the studio's future is bright."
Oscar Garcia Mompean,2019-04-11T04:00:00.000Z,"A game made by people who love the medium in which they work, they have not hesitated to reflect it on the screen and that love shows. A magnificent level design, an outstanding graphic finish and a combination of retro and current gameplay make the game of Thierry Boulanger one of the best indies you will find on your PS4."
João Canelo,2019-03-31T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a nostalgic bomb and a very solid action platformer. If you love Ninja Gaiden and Mega Man, and you want a new, yet friendlier experience in the genre, this is the game you’re looking for."
Marco Ravetto,2019-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a great example of ""old school platform"". It's fun to play, challenging but never frustrating, with good graphics and an excellent soundtrack."
Stephen Wilds,2019-03-26T04:00:00.000Z,The Messenger is a retro-styled old school challenge that starts off easy but will soon test any player's hidden ninja skills. This is a multi-genre homage to some real classics that manages to feel like a long lost gem.
Josh Shoup,2019-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is without a doubt a game that gamers should not pass up on. I very much enjoyed every aspect of the game from the hilarious banter between the Messenger and the shopkeeper to the platforming and the boss fights. I cannot see any one aspect of the game I did not enjoy. If this is the first game made by Sabotage Studio, then I would say that they have a bright future ahead of them in the games industry."
Rossko Keniston,2019-03-25T04:00:00.000Z,"After several hours of dying and dying again the game gives you reason to think it’s all over before it just isn’t, and this could throw some people off. It certainly did me, whilst it’s no bother at all to keep playing The Messenger the pacing felt a little strange in the closing moments, and there’s a fair amount of backtracking to be getting on with. Fortunately this allows you to head back to old levels that have a 16-bit remix that you wouldn’t have seen before, which makes it worthwhile all the more."
John-Paul Jones,2019-03-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Resolutely challenging without ever being unfair, frequently gut-bustingly humorous and stuffed with all manner of unexpected twists and turns, The Messenger one of the most essential platformers on PS4. It really is that simple."
Seb Hawden,2019-03-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Just go out and buy this amazing game now. It’s brilliant, funny, well made and nostalgic. Its soundtrack is to die for, it’s gameplay simple yet technical and the whole presentation on offer deserves the highest praise. Its characters and dialogue are well written and comical, it points fun at itself, at video game culture and it’s delightful."
Francisco Maia,2019-03-20T04:00:00.000Z,"Just as surprising as the plot twists is the entertainment provided by The Messenger's dialogues. The gameplay is great and represents an evolution of the games that it takes inspiration from, but it's the unforeseen events, in the good sense, that makes this journey fantastic."
Stephen Tailby,2019-03-19T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a rock solid action platformer that balances out its retro stylings with modern touches and brilliantly slick controls. Blasting through the lengthy story is compelling, as new story beats and abilities are thrown into the mix. It perhaps flies a little too close to the sun later on as you hunt down the final few collectibles, but by and large, it's a cloud-stepping joy. Fans of 2D action games should have a blast with this, and that's a message we're happy to pass along."
Gabriel Carli,2018-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a game that, despite being heavily influenced by the classics, should be played by all. It has very few flaws and is good through and through. Its art direction is stunning, its soundtrack is exceptional, its level design is marvellous and its gameplay is intuitive, but it's not as innovative as it should be."
Chris Davis,2018-12-03T05:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger has a unique spin that sets it apart from other games and yet, ironically, it lacks an identity of its own. As a modern Ninja Gaiden game it’s excellent, but it only maintains that for half the game. The other half is a faint-hearted attempted at a Metroidvania that never quite works. I thoroughly enjoyed eight to nine hours of my twelve-hour playthrough. The other three or four were a little more tedious than I would have liked but that shouldn’t entirely negate a brilliant platformer with plenty to offer even in a year that’s been chock full of throwback retro platformers."
Pedro Mesquita,2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a marvel of a game in the form of tributes to classical 8 and 16-bit series, with accompanying styles to match. With its surprisingly involving and hilarious plot, The Messenger manages to feature both plenty of action and exploration in a retro style and to grab the player's attention to its events in a way that few games of a similar style do."
Evan Rowe,2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is one of the most successful contemporary takes on 80s and 90s platforming I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Where many games attempt to cash in on easy nostalgia plays and fall short of impressing anybody, The Messenger wholeheartedly embraces the design philosophies from the era of its inspiration and uses them as a framework for experimentation rather than a set of guidelines to be ignored as often as they're followed."
Sean Colleli,2018-10-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Packed with clever story surprises and dynamic, richly-constructed gameplay, The Messenger is both a tribute to and affectionate pastiche of 8 and 16-bit game design, storytelling and nostalgia. It belongs in every Switch owner's eShop library."
Parham Aghakhani,2018-09-24T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is more than a mere homage to games from 80s and 90s and especially, Ninja Gaiden; because through its stunning looks, clever writing, fantastic soundtrack and amazing gameplay, it has created its own identity and turned out vastly superior to all of those titles. It's a quality game that makes you want to get back to it as fast as you can and play more. The Messenger is a must-play and no one should miss it"
Robert Marrujo,2018-09-20T04:00:00.000Z,The Messenger is a real accomplishment for the fledgling Sabotage Studio.
David Infante,2018-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Sabotage first game not only is a love letter to the genre, but also one of the greatest games of the year. The Messenger is a tough but fair game that charms the players with the story and it's characters. Also tries to break new ground in the genre with some of the mechanics we found in the game."
Ricky da Conceição,2018-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a fascinating exercise in genre reinvention, a showcase for two radically different approaches to homage."
Jesús Díaz-Suelto Berrueco,2018-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger exudes charisma and is wrapped with fantastic control and a development full of surprises, with a difficulty curve that few titles match. In the second half of the game there are somewhat uglier details that do not make the set worse but they do leave a feeling that it could have been a little better."
Kosta Andreadis,2018-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,"But even so, The Messenger features an understanding of design, from the 8-bit to the 16-bit to the modern era, that make it more than a throwback."
Robert Scarpinito,2018-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger goes beyond paying its respects to the games of the past, effectively using the time shifting as a homage to the 8- and 16-bit eras. It’s more than a gimmick, acting as both a game mechanic and a storytelling tool. The interesting narrative draws you in while the clever writing breaks the fourth wall to make you laugh. The tight controls keep you playing, despite the slight tedium of the Metroidvania segments. The Messenger toes the line between being a tribute to old-school games and being a modern game with a fresh feeling."
David Valero,2018-09-10T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger has all the necessary elements to become the indie of the year or at least to fight it with arguments of weight. A design of outstanding levels, battles with bosses very satisfactory, plot with a lot of chicha and fun to tons. So tie your sword to your belt and jump without fear of adventure."
Patrice Naderi,2018-09-08T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is an almost entirely well-made Genremix, which has his issues with the difficulty in the second half, but thanks to the humour, the flawless gameplay, the lovely artwork and the score the title manages to succeed in every discipline. Jump N`Run and Indiegaming Fans can`t go around this one"
Mitchell Saltzman,2018-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,"When you're fully geared up and The Messenger is hitting you with brand new stages and challenges that you haven't seen before, The Messenger is an amazing, must-play experience. Taken as a whole, it's brought down only by fetch quests that make The Messenger last several hours longer than it feels like it should."
A.J. Maciejewski,2018-09-05T04:00:00.000Z,"Ninja games have been around since 8-bit classics like Ninja Gaiden, Strider, and Shadow of the Ninja. The Messenger fits right in with its tight gameplay, challenging degree of difficulty, and satisfying campaign."
Patrick Landry,2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"Sabotage created a game filled with nostalgia in a very positive way. This is one of the best game of the year so far! Every gamer who's played retro classics like Ninja Gaiden or Strider, should give this one a try."
Nate Hohl,2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is a game that makes no effort to hide who its intended audience is, and its clever combining of two distinct gameplay genres ensures that it casts a rather wide net. Whether you're a die-hard retro gaming fan or a genre newbie eager to dive into the deep end, Sabotage's debut title is one adventure worth embarking on."
Zhiqing Wan,2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"Overall, The Messenger is a really solid game for fans of the platformer and Metroidvania genres. Had the first half of the game been a little more condensed, and the second half not been too dragged out, the game could've been near-perfect. Even so, if you have even an appreciation for retro or old-school games, you can't go wrong with The Messenger."
Dean James,2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger is easily one of the best indie games in recent years where you can see the passion of the developer in nearly every aspect of the gameplay, complete with some unique twists along the way."
Zack Palm,2018-09-04T04:00:00.000Z,"The Messenger leans on classic platformers from the 80s and 90s, but comes with plenty of its own tricks to make it feel like a wonderful twist with plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor."
Andrea Fontanesi,2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,"How difficult it is to make all this coexist in a single product, yet The Messenger succeeds, moreover with a maniacal attention to detail and an overall harmony "
Evan Norris,2018-09-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Arguably the finest 2D action-adventure of 2018, a year that has seen an influx of well-crafted Metroidvanias."
Jason Flatt,2021-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"While an older entry in the genre, Nuclear Throne is still creative and fun and feels totally fresh in the sea of bullet hells. It has just enough to it to keep you going, though, by comparison to more robust roguelikes, it has the potential to dry up after a while if you’re not mastering it fast enough. Nonetheless, it’s well worth a dive into, especially with its appearance on Xbox Game Pass."
Mitch Vogel,2019-04-09T04:00:00.000Z,"If you’re a fan of Enter the Gungeon, roguelikes, or difficult games in general, Nuclear Throne is going to be right up your alley; we’d give this one a high recommendation."
Casey Gibson,2019-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,"It runs flawlessly in both handheld and docked modes, the pixel art looks great with interesting character and enemy design, offers co-op play, and the amount of variation between each run keeps it fresh as you slam your head against the wall again and again on the way to the throne. The difficulty is absolutely harsh and is sure to turn some off, but feels completely fair, outside of the rare fake chest which can quickly destroy an otherwise promising run. However, no matter how frustrating a death can be, I constantly found myself right back into it without a second thought."
Jonathan Gordon,2016-04-08T04:00:00.000Z,Sets a new benchmark for twin-stick shooters
A.J. Maciejewski,2016-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,Nuclear Throne is a thrilling rogue-like twin stick shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.
Ashley Gill,2016-01-31T05:00:00.000Z,Nuclear Throne's nearly a perfect entry into the roguelike-like genre for anyone who's butt needs a throne to sit and ego needs a beat down.
Tommy Daniels,2016-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,I would recommend Nuclear Throne to anyone that likes video games.
David Shimomura,2016-01-27T05:00:00.000Z,"""Point, click, boom"" in its most distilled form"
Marcus Jones,2016-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,"Nuclear Throne is an addicting game, especially given its simple, yet challenging design. Each mutant feels unique in their special abilities, and the levels feel like a throwback to classic 8-bit designs. I highly recommend it, especially as those capable of overcoming the main game can look into its co-op options or the daily and weekly challenges Vlambeer throws in for fun."
Simon Fitzgerald,2016-01-08T05:00:00.000Z,"Nuclear Throne is one of the greatest rogue-like games that we have ever played: the gunplay is very satisfying, the characters and their creative abilities are wonderfully wacky, and the entire experience has so much variety that it becomes very addictive. If you are a fan of rogue-likes or simply want an outstanding game to play, then we suggest that you let Vlambeer's latest rule over your PlayStation lands, 'cause it's definitely ruling over ours."
Alexander Chatziioannou,2015-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,"Nuclear Throne is impeccably presented and tightly designed. There is enough variety in characters, upgrades and weapons to ensure that playthroughs never get repetitive and its visceral combat is a joy in itself. Its frustrating unfairness, however, holds it back and may alienate even hardcore roguelike fans. Not the heir to Isaac's throne many had hoped for then, but still the best action roguelike of 2015."
George Umbarger,2015-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,"Balancing demand for careful planning and perfect execution, Nuclear Throne is a frantic funhouse of procedurally-generated carnage."
John-Paul Jones,2015-12-21T05:00:00.000Z,"Multi-layered in its sophistication while being drenched in aesthetic bombast and effortlessly entertaining, Nuclear Throne isn't just Vlambeer's finest work to date, it also happens to be the best twin-stick shooter since Helldivers; even in light of its relatively minor transgressions."
Daniel Tack,2015-12-16T05:00:00.000Z,"While the core game can be completed by a skilled player in under an hour, plenty of roguelike randomness and challenges keep you coming back"
Chloi Rad,2015-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,Nuclear Throne is an enjoyably tough run-and-gun with tons of energy and variety to justify hours and hours of replays.
Jordan Devore,2015-12-15T05:00:00.000Z,"In the end, I have come to love and loathe Nuclear Throne. It's one of the hardest, most rewarding games I've ever played. But as satisfying as it can eventually become, I think it is far too demanding for its own good. With additional polish and balancing, this could be a masterpiece in the genre. It's not quite there yet, but it's close."
Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,2015-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,"A crowning achievement for Vlambeer, and one of the finest action-roguelikes ever made."
James Slack,2015-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,"Nuclear Throne revels in its own madness as a twin-stick shooter that could easily stand shoulder to shoulder with any other in the genre. While the repetitive nature of locales does grate after a while, it's still difficult to not come back for one more game time and time again."
David Jenkins,2015-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,"Another perfectly constructed neo-arcade game from the makers of Luftrausers, which perfectly marries twin stick shooters with roguelike punishment."
Jeffrey Matulef,2015-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,Vlambeer's latest pocket of panicky delight is an intense arcade roguelike that rivals Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac.
John Walker,2015-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,"If you're the sort who shies away from bullet hell twin-stick shooters, or finds the permadeath of roguelikes to be too punishing, I think Nuclear Throne might be the game to try. It might well ease you into those troubling waters. I tend toward those instincts too, but this is so immediately accessible, so ridiculously replayable, and so satisfying to get better at, that it transcends. And if those sorts of games are your thing and you've not already delved in during development, then flipping crikey, get this immediately. And blimey, I'm tired."
Andrei Dumitrescu,2015-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,"Nuclear Throne manages to walk a fine line between challenging, with options for the player who wants to succeed in the post-apocalypse, and unfairly difficult, filled with obstacles that will induce frustration for even the most hardened fans of the rogue-like genre."
Gianluca Arena,2020-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Dandara Trials of Fear is the best version of the game so far, and it's absolutely free for Dandara owners. All the rest of the people should give this metroidvania a chance."
Ville Kovanen,2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"""Gravity is not a restriction."""
Alireza Abroshan,2020-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"If you are a fan of Metroidvania and Platformer games, we highly recommend this title. The game offers great content for its low price, and is well worth the purchase. Of course, the game is somewhat difficult. It can get a bit challenging and tiresome, but there are cheats in the game that can reduce some of the difficulty. The art direction is also pleasing and makes your playthrough, an enjoyable one. One could consider this game to be a difficult title designed for hardcore gamers, but unlike the Souls games, the difficulty can be adjusted"
Anthony Bacchus,2020-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Regardless of your platform of choice, Dandara: Trials of Fear Edition needs to be your next game."
James Luff,2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Initially I was warmed by the retro inspired pixel graphics and music. Dandara dares to be different and it just works. Crazy difficulty spikes made the later areas of the game quite frustrating. Regardless, I can’t deny I still had a lot of fun and the game made me look up some history which is good in my books. As I returned to replay the game I thought about the real Dandara and her struggle to fight against an incredibly difficult cause for the time. While the fight against slavery doesn’t compare to the the struggle of finishing a video game. I spent around two hours fighting the final boss before I succeeded. The lesson I guess I picked up from this is never give up no matter what. You can make it through."
Fernando Sánchez,2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Dandara was a game with high qualifications, and now that it has an expansion that, in addition to new content, also gives it soul, we cannot stop recommending it. A metroidvania different in style and implementation, but just as addictive and recommended as its most notable peers in the genre."
Łukasz Ankudo,2020-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,Dandara is a metaphor of troubles in early Brazil. The developers use well known folklore and story of real life Dandara to make a nice platformer. It's a challenging game and not an easy completion.
Stephen Tailby,2019-02-27T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is an intelligent, expertly crafted puzzle game with ceaselessly satisfying gameplay. It becomes bafflingly complex, yet the free-roaming nature of the island means that you'll never be stuck for long. In addition, the way in which it communicates new elements is nothing short of masterful. All in all, Jonathan Blow's latest is an enormous triumph."
Nate Kiernan,2018-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Part of me felt I should enjoy The Witness, that solving it would be its own reward, or that I could not truly say I disliked it until I had unraveled it thoroughly. These are all ridiculous justifications for playing a game I knew early on I disliked. It is such a strong compulsion within the videogame community to compel yourself forward with critically acclaimed games that even your own opinion stops mattering as much for whether you play a game or not. It isn’t about what you think, or what other people think, it’s what you think other people will think."
Łukasz Ankudo,2017-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is a brainchild of Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid. It's praised for being more of an art price than a game. That's not good. The Witness might look interesting, might have a story that we ought to figure out by ourselves, it might even be on of the best. The only thing is that it's a nice puzzle game and nothing more."
Anthony Preece,2017-05-10T04:00:00.000Z,"An engaging title that will encourage you to think outside the box and look at it from some very obtuse angles. It won't take too long to complete but you won't breeze through it either. No DLC that I have heard about so far but there's enough to keep you occupied.

Thought provoking, challenging and above all else entertaining in it's own way."
Kevin Hunt,2017-03-24T04:00:00.000Z,"There is not much to say; and in no way is that a mark against The Witness. On all accounts The Witness exceeds as a puzzle game; in a visually satisfying and perfectly challenging way it presents puzzles for the player to solve. I want to rant and rave about all the puzzles I solved, I want to convene with others and pick their brains over the challenging ones, I want to describe in vast detail the great variety of challenges The Witness presents. But all of this would do a disservice to The Witness; a truly marvelous game which, to the curious problem solver, simply must be played. I wish there were more to add but there is no story, there is no soundtrack, there is no combat, there is no antagonist, there are no upgrades, there is nothing except line puzzles. And in that regard The Witness is a perfect game."
Zoey Hughes,2017-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,The Witness is as devious as it is brilliant and not for the easily distracted.
Wyzzlex,2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,"Putting many unanswered questions aside, The Witness is one of the most interesting games of the last decade. The world is designed beautifully and with an incredible amount of hidden details. Although the riddles can become annoying at some points, you definitely should visit the mysterious island."
Andrew Todd,2016-09-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Blow didn’t just meet expectations; he avoided them entirely, delivering a game that hides deceptive depth in its colourful environment."
Nick Herber,2016-09-26T04:00:00.000Z,I found The Witness to be a fascinating idea that shows an incredible sense of scope. Solving the game's myriad puzzles almost always delivers an incredible sense of satisfaction - an impressive feat when you consider just how many there are to tackle. The island is a truly interesting place to explore and the vast majority of the puzzles work incredibly well with one another and the environment to create a unique if methodical experience that I can easily recommend to fans of puzzle and exploration video games.
Jason Stettner,2016-09-25T04:00:00.000Z,The Witness is a haven for those that love puzzles being a special world for them to explore.
Matt Mirkovich,2016-09-23T04:00:00.000Z,"They really don't make 'em like this any more. The Witness is an amazing game that you'll love to hate for its challenge, cursing it, wondering why you made the purchase, and then something will click for you, and it'll become one of the best games you've ever played."
Rhys Thom,2016-09-22T04:00:00.000Z,"Even though The Witness can become a bit of a slog at times with an obscene amount of puzzles - which border or repetitive - and the ability to easily lose your bearings, it's definitely one you should at least dip your mind into, if only for an hour."
Brennan Dyal,2016-09-19T04:00:00.000Z,"Brennan Dyal lives in Baltimore, and actually likes it. When he's not playing games, he's disappointing his teammates on the basketball court, or going to Popeye's in disguise so they don't ask ""Weren't you just here yesterday?"""
Ken McKown,2016-09-16T04:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is an example of superlative game design. Carefully crafted and mentally challenging. Everyone should dive into this world, it is the perfect game for several players to sit on a couch and solve. It will make your head hurt, it will tease your brain more than any game before it, but it also delivers satisfaction in solution better than anything else before, and perhaps after it. Play this game."
Dae Jim,2016-09-15T04:00:00.000Z,The Witness is a fantastic experience that everyone should play and love. Great looking graphics are walking hand in hand with fun and challenging puzzle gameplay.
Bob Fekete,2016-09-13T04:00:00.000Z,"If you like puzzle games and haven't played The Witness, now's the perfect time. If you're curious at all about it, definitely give it a try. If you know you do not care for puzzle games or something as slow-paced as The Witness, be sure to steer clear for your own sake."
William Schwartz,2016-09-12T04:00:00.000Z,"This Xbox One version of the Witness stands shoulder to should with its PC and PlayStation 4 counterparts, delivering the same content we saw in those releases with a comparable visual fidelity."
Stacey Knowles,2016-09-11T04:00:00.000Z,A remarkable open world puzzler that never loses faith in the intelligence of the player.
Jason Scott,2016-04-06T04:00:00.000Z,I fell in and out of love with The Witness so many times throughout my time with it that by the end I was as confused about my thoughts as I was about the plot.
Fardin Bagherian,2016-03-05T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is a difficult yet rewarding puzzle game that will keep your mind occupied for a very long time. If you like puzzles, you'll love The Witness. But if don't like puzzles, then don't play it as it'll make you feel stupid!"
Robert Workman,2016-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"I may never figure out what's going on inside the head of Jonathan Blow – or what the deal really was with that ""piss jug"" picture he posted on Twitter – but there's no denying his savvy when it comes to game development."
Jed Whitaker,2016-02-17T05:00:00.000Z,"You'll either love or hate The Witness as it will either make you feel smart or stupid. If you don't love puzzles and deep philosophical thoughts, perhaps avoid this one."
Jason Faulkner,2016-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,"I really wish that I could have enjoyed The Witness in the way so many others seem to. I tried, really I did. I attempted to see what was so ""mindtwisting,"" ""transcendental,"" or how it provokes ""natural epiphanies."" I just couldn't though. All I saw were endless line puzzles which felt like endless padding, like the creation of the island itself was as far as the developer got in planning and then realized they had to have some sort of driving mechanism to justify it. The depressing thing about it all is that it's such a waste. The island is a lovely place, and its oversaturated colors give just the right touch to a world that is vaguely fantastical. If Blow had put some variety into the puzzles, preferably using the excellent environment to its fullest, and actually telling a story instead of the lazy minimalistic mess that we got, this title could have been a Myst for a new generation. Instead, it's a dull, frustrating, pointless hike through a lovely, colorful, dead place. If you're looking for the same effect on the cheap, I recommend a box of crayons, a puzzle book, and a nice coloring sheet. You can use the money you have left over to get a game worth your time."
Darren Carle,2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is at once beautiful, intricate and alluring whilst being obtuse, unsympathetic and draining. It's not for everyone and few will see all it has to offer. It can punish as much as it rewards. Yet there is little else like it in the field of games, or indeed anywhere else, and whilst these small blemishes may prevent The Witness from being an outright classic, it remains a peerless example of videogame form."
Dan Solberg,2016-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is, above all else, a designed space. And while all videogames are designed spaces in their own right, The Witness does away with the façade that it's anything but a designed space."
Eric Van Allen,2016-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is a profound experience, unlike any other and certainly intimidating in its refusal to give away its secrets for free. However, those with the inclination to buy-in and delve deep will find a trove of excellence, in the way it utilizes simple mechanics to convey greater themes. One of the most cohesive and intricate releases you can find, but not for the faint of heart."
"Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus",2016-02-08T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is a masterpiece of game design and an early contender for one of the best titles of the year. Boiled down to the basics, it's just a series of increasingly complex puzzle-mazes, but the presentation and execution are stellar, and the sense of exploration really adds to the game. It captures just the right sense of maddening and enticing to keep you moving forward. Its high price might scare off some gamers, but those who give it a shot will find it to be a worthwhile experience."
Austin Adamson,2016-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,The Witness is at its best when it is teaching you its mechanics simply by exploring the world and playing the game.
Joanna Nelius,2016-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,"The beauty of The Witness is that the puzzles transcend language itself. They pull you through a broad range of emotions – anguish, despair, desperation – but, once you finally solve that seemingly impossible puzzle, you can raise your fists in the air, victorious, and maybe taunt the game a little bit."
Francesco De Meo,2016-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is an excellent puzzle game, featuring many complex yet fair puzzles, a great atmosphere, an interesting narrative method and a lot of content. With no handholding whatsoever, The Witness certainly is not a game for everyone, but those who are up to the challenge will feel enriched once they solve most of the puzzles included in the game. 

After all the delays, Jonathan Blow and his crew fully delivered."
Carlos Chism,2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"When The Witness can give the player just enough of a push, it communicates these ideas in beautiful ways. When it leaves the player to their own devices, or throws too many rules into a single area or panel, then its philosophies and ideas wind up lost in translation."
Akhil Arora,2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Its insistence at not providing answers and straying away from the safety of regular rewards can be off-putting. The Witness wants to be more than a game filled with puzzles, but Blow's singular vision lets it down."
Matt Sainsbury,2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"I never thought I'd like a puzzle game this much, and I can't believe a game that isn't a JRPG is a game of the year contender to me. Jon Blow and Thekla have really created something special here, and while it has been a very long wait (I hope that the next one doesn't take eight years to complete...), the long development time has been used to good effect. The Witness is so much more than puzzles in an open world. It is itself an enigma and puzzle, and something far greater than the sum of its individual parts."
Keith Milburn,2016-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Not so much filled with ""a-ha!"" moments. They're more like epiphanies."
Richard Moss,2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness is one of the most fulfilling games I've played in yonks and it accomplishes a rare feat. It's varied, playful, elegant, mysterious, challenging, and intensely focused all at the same time."
Ben Thomas,2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,The Witness is a challenging and eye-opening puzzle experience that has been designed with such precision that it can alter your thought process for a long time.
Mark Brown,2016-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,"The Witness offers challenging, if somewhat repetitive puzzles in a world soaked with unique artistic style. If you like maze puzzles, have the patience of a Shaolin monk and are interested in an experience that can only be described as challenging, repetitive and yet meditative - this game is for you."
Clarissa Witt,2018-08-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Without giving away too much, Night in the Woods comprises of incredibly dark moments, an exploration of topics like economic depression, mental health, religion and growing up, lots of interesting and fun sides and funny moments. I feel the characters are really well developed and a lot of thought has been put into their backstories, and fleshing out their personalities. The game itself is aesthetically pleasing with a hand drawn cartoony feel and gameplay is really smooth. Where I feel the game could have improved is towards the end, where you find out what’s been going on the whole time and it all happens all very fast and at once. For me I would have liked more here either in the form of more dialogue or just an extra bit of gameplay. Overall as a small indie game I think it’s done very well."
Seth Hay,2018-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is a powerful, story-driven game that shows that not all games need action if you have strong characters and fun mini-games. Oh and beating up a furnace with a bat is fun, too."
Daniel New,2018-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Poignant, sometimes sad, but also joyous and gut-wrenchingly funny, Night in the Woods is a bold, brave game that will be be recognised as an all time great."
احسان محمدی,2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,"The moment you step in the Possum Springs, You'll fall in love with it. Setting the bar high for interactive storytelling, Night in the Woods does every other thing just right; from magical artistic design to charming music to smart dialogues. One of the best indie titles in the recent years."
Gianluca Arena,2018-02-21T05:00:00.000Z,"Leaving Possum Sprigns is one of the hardest things we've done in the last years of gaming: Mae Borowski and her fellow young adults have left a memorable stain in our hearts, and we're already looking forward to go visit them again. Don't miss one of the best narrative experiences ever."
Dylan Burns,2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,"An interactive story like nothing I’ve played, I couldn’t recommend Night in the Woods as a light experience. It is, however, quite an interesting and impactful one, and one that has kept me thinking, even as I write this review."
Drew Hurley,2018-02-18T05:00:00.000Z,This is an adventure game the likes of which is rarely seen anymore and is completely unlike anything else on Switch.
Nazih Fares,2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is the good kind of narrative game, full of rich and deep topic, topped with a simple gameplay and witty humour. A short experience, but a must have for those of you that never played it when launched back in early 2017."
Jack Olohan,2018-02-14T05:00:00.000Z,"I must say that Night in the Woods has me intrigued and already I want to play through it again to get what I missed and spend some more time with Gregg. It's certainly a satisfying experience and if you are looking for a story driven title to play then Night in the Woods is certainly for you, even if the ending left me annoyed."
Ryan Janes,2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is an incredible, heartfelt journey that goes above and beyond anything currently on Switch when it comes to its character development and storytelling. While the pacing might not be to everyone’s tastes, Night in the Woods is a truly unforgettable experience and one I’m sure we’ll be talking about for years to come."
David Martinez,2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods tells a sad story in many levels. We love the art direction and the soundtrack (specially in minigames and dream levels), but it is not a game for everyone. Gameplay falls short compared to narrative elements."
Rossko Keniston,2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,Night in the Woods and it's one of the most important experiences I've had as an enthusiast of this industry for over 30 years.
Senja Littman,2018-02-07T05:00:00.000Z,"""Exceptionally well told story about our everyday problems."""
Justin Nation,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"I think the decision point with a game like Night in the Woods revolves around how much reality you want in your games. If you’re looking purely for an escape, to turn your mind off and simply enjoy yourself, Night in the Woods very much won’t be for you… at all. If, instead, you view games through the lens of entertainment that can also have something to say or to reveal to you about people who may be living very different lives than you I would absolutely say you should check it out. I don’t know that I’ve ever played a game with characters that remind me so much of my own children, some of their struggles, and how sometimes people’s traits being positives or negatives can be very heavily driven by perspective and context. I can’t think of any game I’ve played in quite some time that made me reflect on as many things as Night in the Woods has, and if you’re open to the experience I’d highly recommend it."
Dom Reseigh-Lincoln,2018-02-04T05:00:00.000Z,"Less of a game, and more of an interactive story with some light platforming and exploring to tie it all together, Night In The Woods is one of the most rewarding experiences you can play on Nintendo Switch. A curio better played for yourself than described by us, it's an indie title that will no doubt leave an impression with its enchanting soundtrack, disarming story and instantly identifiable character arcs. Both strange and wonderful in equal measure, few games are as easy to recommend as this."
Juan Romero,2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,"A Night in the Woods is a game which requires patience and is best savoured like a good wine or meal. There is lots to explore, many strands of story to uncover, and Possom Springs is a place with characters which just draws you in. Once hooked, it doesn't let go until the credits roll. Mae is an imperfect cat with many vulnerabilities and that's why the story resonates so deep; because when you play this there is no doubt that many will have experienced some of the things in this game. Even though it is a supernatural adventure these are just characters living normal lives with everyday problems which the writers have brought to the fore with an excellent written script. I can't promise that this will be for everyone, but I can confidently say that those that are willing to give this one the time it deserves will be richly rewarded."
Sam Spyrison,2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,"Nearly one year later, Night in the Woods remains one of the most quotable and passion-fueled indie titles in recent years."
Muhammad Ali Bari,2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is as charming as ever on the Nintendo Switch. The performance is a bit of a mixed bag and there can be some bugs, but all said, it is a solid port that offers a great experience whether you play it on the big screen or take it with you for some portable adventure."
Alexander Morningstar,2018-02-02T05:00:00.000Z,"The story is great, the music is fine, and the game runs well in both docked and handheld mode. Night in the Woods did not really leave me with a lot of complaints. So if you're interested in trying out a well-written story that is fairly relaxing in gameplay to get through, but also want to immerse yourself in an environment along the lines of something like Oxenfree, then Night in the Woods is definitely a must-have."
Kenneth Shepard,2018-02-01T05:00:00.000Z,"As poignant and raw as ever, Night in the Woods feels more at home on Switch than anywhere else."
Mark Delaney,2018-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,Night in the Woods is a refreshing take on the adventure genre.
Brendan Lowry,2017-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,"Though some of its gameplay can feel overly repetitive, Night in the Woods soundly delivers a relatable, impactful narrative that will keep players attached for the ride, from start to finish — all held together by beautiful stylized graphics."
Javier Ulises Lopez,2017-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"A very particular story driven game stood out from many others during this year, is Night in the Woods worth your time and money or is it another game of the bunch?"
Adam Riley,2017-04-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is an expertly written story wrapped up in a 2D platform adventure blanket. Whilst not the epitome of actual gaming, it can still hold its own in the face of competition. What makes Infinite Fall's piece of entertainment so compelling, though, is definitely its charm and storytelling expertise, providing such an engrossing tale, complete with sublime audio-visual presentation, making this an essential purchase for those that love to be drawn completely into the world they are playing through."
Gabriel Cavalcanti,2017-04-27T04:00:00.000Z,"A beautiful game with a fitting soundtrack, Night in the Woods pleases with its writing but fails in everything else with artificial choices, pacing problems, and an ending that doesn't go with the tone set in the beginning."
Sean Anthony,2017-04-14T04:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is a fantastic narrative with a beautiful artstyle, theme and plenty of small touches occupying a wonderful world full of loving characters covering a sinister story underneath."
Raymond Porreca,2017-03-30T04:00:00.000Z,"All of this -- the unique pieces that make up Night in the Woods -- goes back to why it's so damn hard to define the game. There isn't an adequate term for titles that blend clunky platforming with choose-you-own-adventure friendship simulators. Nor is there a word to describe games that feature knife-fighting minigames and Guitar Hero-inspired band practices. But, again, maybe that's a big part of Night in the Woods' appeal. It's a confident outsider, and one that takes pleasure is celebrating the weird ways that everything comes together in life."
Seamus Mullins,2017-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Featuring a quirky and charming art style and a fittingly subtle and cute soundtrack, Night in the Woods is a serious look at life and at its hardest moments in its various forms – In particular mental health and making the transition to adulthood. It's also a look at the best bits of life, deep and meaningful relationships and connections, edgy clothes, and of course terrible puns. It's a tight knit package with more depth than I ever could have imagined going in, and well worth the price of admission."
Afshin Piroozi,2017-03-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods has a great and deep story but in terms of gameplay, doesn't have anything new or creative but the story always make you want to finish the game."
Kat Brewster,2017-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,"This brilliant patchwork of storytelling, vandalism and melancholic reminiscences at the local mall is set to go down as a millennial classic"
Hayden Dingman,2017-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods may be a pastiche of influences, but as far as video games go, there's really nothing else like it, and there's a lot to be learned from spending a dozen days in Mae's life—about her and her friends, about yourself, about America and towns forgotten by time."
Hossein Sadri,2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,"As a gamer, I care about ""how to say"" more than ""what to say"". Night in the Woods has a great story but doesn't know how to narrate it. So all we have is a boring adventure game that makes you fall asleep."
Carlos G. Gurpegui,2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,"Night in the Woods is an universal game about the fear of becoming and adult. A fear to struggle with politcs, money and family. A fear to lose your beloved ones and yourself. A fear to life itself. But it's also a survival guide to life and adultness and one of the best written videogames of the last few months."
Stephan Adamus,2017-03-13T04:00:00.000Z,"The Samurai Jack-like graphics seem cutesy, but Night in the Woods earns a master class in tone."
Tiago Herrmann,2021-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is an immersive space exploration experience that oozes originality. Its vibrant world design works as a great puzzle full of beauty and charm that always aims to stimulate the player's curiosity, while transmitting the fear of the new and the inhospitable. Even with occasional failures, here we have an experience marked by creative excellence that exposes the true concept of freedom in electronic games."
Zach Snyder,2020-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a great piece of work, one absolutely deserving of titles and high praise."
Jon Peltz,2019-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a meditative, slow, but ultimately rewarding sci-fi extravaganza that everyone looking for an adventure should play — but be prepared for some frustration and repetition."
Stephen Tailby,2019-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a game that presents itself in a unique way, and trusts you to put together its compelling mystery without assistance"
Isaac Monterose,2019-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,"In the end, Outer Wilds is all about exploring a mysterious solar system and finding out its secrets. I had a fun time flying around in space and it’s good for the gaming industry as a whole to have an adventure game like this that’s about exploring a world without having to shoot or fight enemies. However, Outer Wilds doesn’t do a great job at guiding players. Instead, you are left aimlessly exploring until you figure out what to do next."
Brad Lang,2019-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a monumental success in video game design and storytelling and should be experienced by anyone who sees the value in immersive, interactive storytelling despite its graphical hitches on PS4"
Meghan Hughes,2019-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Though occasionally frustrating, Outer Wilds presents a unique experience to explore a world with few limitations."
John-Paul Jones,2019-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a furiously imaginative work that elevates storytelling and player discovery to a whole new level. Though less than inspired puzzles and some technical issues threaten to take the sheen off the experience, Outer Wilds nonetheless sits in a class all its own on PS4."
Maddy Myers,2019-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is not a power fantasy. It is a game about discovering how little power you have, and how maybe that isn’t as scary as you might initially have thought. The galaxy is huge, but you can still make your mark on a small part of it."
Thomas Hughes,2019-07-16T04:00:00.000Z,"At its core, Outer Wilds is a game about exploration, knowledge and experimentation. It's the sum of all those parts and more, perfectly blending them together to create one of the most fascinating games of this generation. Outer Wilds proves a micro - as opposed to a macro - take on space exploration works just as well, if not better."
Colin Campbell,2019-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,"I encounter other space explorers of my own kind. They are bizarre, likable clue-givers who provide moments of comic relief. I perpetrate no violence in this game. I am never required to fire a laser gun or grapple with enemies. (How few are the games, set in space, that absent themselves from combat.) Yet, the worlds I visit can be hostile, releasing their secrets with the greatest reluctance."
Joe Morgan,2019-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a big, beautiful game spanning an entire solar system that celebrates discovery while, at the same time, slaps you in the mouth for getting too curious."
Thomas Pillon,2019-07-09T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is simply a wonderful and brilliant space exploration adventure. Inside an hand-crafted solar system, the game is an ode to adventure and curiosity where you journey through space, trying to understand the stakes of a quantic situation."
Andrew King,2019-07-08T04:00:00.000Z,"Complaining about Outer Wilds inscrutability is a little like criticizing Rome because you don’t know which sights to see. Do a measly Google search. Mobius Digital has, at times, erred on the side of giving players too little information. But, as a result, they have created a world that casts you as Isaac Newton. They are eagerly waiting for you to discover its gravity."
Corey Hoffmeyer,2019-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,Outer Wilds is a time-bending thrill ride that never ceases to amaze.
Furkan Güler,2019-07-01T04:00:00.000Z,Outer Wilds is ver unique adventure game. Also fundemental mechanics are very fun.
Jake Green,2019-06-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is easily my game of the year thus far, and continues to move up the list of my personal favorite games of all time. It's an experience I genuinely cannot stop thinking about, managing to encompass everything I love about the adventure gaming genre and the smart sci-fi musings of my all-time favorite authors. The few negatives brought on by the time loop at the game's core are universally outweighed by the pioneering spirit cultivated throughout. I urge you to seek out Outer Wilds if you can, if only to try out what is surely one of the greatest adventure games ever created."
Mick Fraser,2019-06-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is good-looking and quite unique in its subgenre, and there's a compelling, intriguing mystery to solve that will keep you guessing as you progress across the galaxy"
Richard Costa,2019-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a triumphant first-person exploration adventure with innovative (quantum) physics puzzles. More than that, it's a microcosm in itself that pleads to be explored and untangled in its minutiae."
"Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus",2019-06-18T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is a genuinely delightful experience with a lot of bright points. It somehow manages to take the idea of a game about repeatedly dying in terrible ways and makes it enjoyable, relaxing and enthusiastic. It won't be a game for everyone due to its self-guided nature and its focus on puzzling things out for yourself, but it's exactly the game it needs to be. If you long for the space travel that No Man's Sky couldn't provide, give Outer Wilds a shot. It might not have a billion worlds, but each one is worth a visit."
Víctor Rodríguez,2019-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds is one of the greatest surprises we have received. A game that mixes exploration with a Groundhog Day-like scheme and a charismatic narrative to give, as a result, something truly unique. A hidden gem that everyone should try."
Aaron Riccio,2019-06-12T04:00:00.000Z,This is a rare adventure game in which the journey is actually more of a reward than the destination.
Alessandro Barbosa,2019-06-09T04:00:00.000Z,Outer Wilds is a poignant space explorer with an emotionally engrossing tale set across a condensed but wildly surprising solar system.
Nathan Birch,2019-06-07T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds gets most of the ""big picture"" stuff right. It boasts a solid structure, wonderfully imaginative planets, and an involving slow-burn mystery. Unfortunately, clunky controls, a few irritating design choices, and a multitude of other little issues bring the game back down to earth. If you value originality over execution, Outer Wilds is worth the ride, but expect some turbulence."
Kenneth Araullo,2019-06-06T04:00:00.000Z,"If I ever find myself in my own closed time-loop, I’d wish for me to play the Outer Wilds, but with the added bonus of forgetting about it, just so I can experience it all over again. It’s that good, and the first true title that I could say is a 'must-play' for 2019.
"
Kim Snaith,2019-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,Each new discovery or observation brings with it a real sense of joy and wonder and the pleasing notion that you’re the first person to behold each particular oddity. 
Javy Gwaltney,2019-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds offers an incredible world filled with memorable moments, but the experience is hamstrung by poorly implemented puzzles and wonky systems"
A.J. Maciejewski,2019-06-03T04:00:00.000Z,"Enjoying Outer Wilds depends on your willingness to read guides and discuss the game online. Otherwise, you'll probably feel like you're regularly hitting your head on a brick wall as you try to make just an inch of progress."
Davide Mancini,2019-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wild is a brilliant Sundance Sci-Fi experience, with a perfect balance between space exploration, mystery solving and storytelling. The solar system designed by Mobius Digital is an outstanding playground, full of odd surprises and unique events. Above all, is a place worth to explore and it's perfectly integrated into the time loop structure of the game. If you love to feel a genuine sense of discovery and adventure, it's definitely your game."
Chris Jecks,2019-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,"If you’re looking for a breath of fresh air and fancy venturing out into space for a laid back exploration and a damned good time, Outer Wilds should be your first port of call."
Edwin Evans-Thirlwell,2019-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,"There's a twofold joy to Outer Wilds - the thrill of discovery itself, as you slowly decipher the variables that swirl around each not-so-distant world, and of seeing that thrill reflected in a phrase scribbled centuries ago by some castaway alien boffin."
Mike Epstein,2019-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,Exploring the uncharted worlds of Outer Wilds feels like a true adventure in ways most games never achieve.
Jason Faulkner,2019-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,"As someone who loves adventure and puzzle games, Outer Wilds was a match made in heaven. 
"
Lawrence Le,2019-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,A tale straight from our childhood tree forts—Outer Wilds will reawaken the passion for exploration that you thought you lost.
Ricky Knight,2019-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,"There’s so much to talk about that most of it is truly best left unsaid, as your path to these discoveries will be very much your own. I hope bigger games take some of Outer Wilds’ design lessons to heart. There’s nothing quite like it right now and there should be.
"
Josh Tolentino,2019-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Outer Wilds proves there's still a sense of genuine adventure to be gained from games that commit to a set, fixed structure and design, rather than the kind of sprawling, endless expanses many contemporary titles set out to become. Playing it brought to mind my favorite bits of Dr. Seuss' Oh, The Places You'll Go...except with more of the sun exploding.
"
Patryk Dzięglewicz,2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The three additions collected together to the poop are a solid expansion of the Frostpunk universe. Only the price for each of them can stop the desire to buy, but new players in the topic is offered a complete edition of the game easier to swallow for the wallet."
Sarwar Ron,2021-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,Frostpunk is a great addition to the genre and console players might want to finally know what all the fuzz was about.
Sina Golabzade,2021-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is one of the best strategy videogames of not only the recent years but maybe all times and now that the whole package is on consoles, it is a great time to experience this hellish ice storm."
Josh Di Falco,2020-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is quite simply one of the best city-building experiences on the PlayStation 4 with a highly detailed narrative written for four huge campaigns. The sadness in there only being four campaigns is a true testament to the team at 11 Bit Studios, as they have crafted such a memorable experience, with gut-wrenching decisions at every turn. The savagery of the game can have long-lasting effects that can carry into the subsequent play-throughs, as the memories of what arose from making previous decisions can sway future decisions down other pathways. For those who wish to experience a more laid-back 'Sim City' like experience, then this title may not be the right title to jump into. However after experiencing this, it will be easy to feel anxious to see whatever the team behind it has in store next."
Martin Bago,2019-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk isn't for everyone, but if you're into hardcore strategy games, there's no reason you won't love the console version as well. The novel setting coupled with the interesting game mechanics will keep you entertained for quite a while."
Kevin Miller,2019-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is in a word awesome, it’s beautifully crafted, enticingly simple and wholly captivating. Words truly do not do the magnificence justice, buy it, play it, love it. Many hours are going to be lost, my children’s names will fade from my mind as I plan my next move. Frostpunk is a city-building game fan’s delight. 11 Bit Studios need to go out and have one hell of a celebration unless that hell freezes over of course.

Frostpunk romps it’s way to an easy Thumb Culture Platinum award."
Stephanie Sung,2019-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is, without a doubt, not an easy game and requires extensive strategizing and multiple playthroughs to succeed."
Amirhossein Dehnavi,2019-10-27T00:00:00.000Z,"The console version of the Frostpunk game has no shortage of its own PC versions, bringing the same complete package to the consoles with great elegance. The new interface, along with the technical achievement and full content at a fair price, even encourages those who have experienced gaming on PCs to experience gaming on the console."
Jacob James,2019-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,Frostpunk: Console Edition is a brutal game where every choice comes at a price.
Chuck Osborn,2019-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Being in charge of a virtual city (and, I imagine, a real city) can be stressful, but rewarding. Take Cities: Skylines for example; there’s the pressure of keeping people happy, but the fun of constructing your own city and seeing it thrive. Now, add being situated in a frozen wasteland where people need warmth and food to survive. The pressure is significantly heightened, and this is what Frostpunk is all about."
Nick Herber,2019-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The slower pacing and somewhat lacking early tutorials give Frostpunk a somewhat high barrier of entry. Do not go in thinking you will be successful right off of the bat. This is a challenging game with some uneven difficulty spikes that can feel punishing and even unfair at times, but the capability to rebound is almost always there, so long as you respond quickly and decisively. Frostpunk will not be for everyone, but fans of survival or city-building games really owe it to themselves to give this one a try now that it has made its way from PC to console."
Connor Trinske,2019-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Despite its graphical compromises, Frostpunk: Console Edition is an excellent way to experience one of the best games of last year."
Łukasz Ankudo,2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is one of the best strategy games released in 2019 thus far. Console version of the game is nice, controls are properly implemented, easy to learn, but controling what's going on on the map with a game pad is difficult. The game plays great and looks amazing, but is missing keyboard and mouse controls, which is possible, but not implemented."
Fernando Sánchez,2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is like catching a city builder, like Maxis's famous Sim City but where our moral decisions can leave a trail of corpses along the way and ultimately fail means our end, or the end of the entire city. It is simply brilliant how moral decisions have been implemented with such great consequences in an almost innocent type of genre such as construction and city management, but 11 bit Studios has managed to do so, and in a very satisfactory way. Highly recommended."
Francisco Maia,2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Whether it's the setting and mature themes presented or the diverse and complex gameplay mechanics, Frostpunk sets an example on how strategy games should be. The immersion is so deep that it is difficult to realize the lost (but well invested) hours. It is a game that deserves your attention and it's absolutely worth of your time."
Kevin Mitchell,2019-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk: Console Edition is a brutal yet highly satisfying survival city management game. At times, you'll agonize over your choices, heck, I couldn't get one in particular out of my mind, even after turning the game off. The console version feels excellent to play thanks to the highly thoughtful control mechanics that make use of every possible button efficiently. Be warned, opening the Xbox guide menu does not automatically pause the game."
Manuel Fritsch,2019-10-10T22:00:00.000Z,"Morally rousing mix of strategy and survival, which convinces with clever comfort functions and good menu navigation even on console."
Justin Oneil,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z," If you’re like me and missed this on PC don’t remain out in the cold, come in and see why it’s so good."
Jarrett Green,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"To say Frostpunk is fun would be like saying watching The Road is fun. It's engaging, challenging, inventive and unique. It cleverly re-purposes old genre tropes, and embraces the rigors of micromanaging dire people in a dark time with such earnest that it's hard not to get charmed into hours of sadistic yet satisfying struggle."
Jez Corden,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,This is a staggering achievement that strategy game fans shouldn't miss out on.
Brandon Adams,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"If you have yet to play Frostpunk and enjoy city-builders you should absolutely give the console edition a look. It's a worthy port of a phenomenal game, and I hope to see more games brought over from PC given this sort of love and attention in the future."
Darryn Bonthuys,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Without skipping a beat from the original PC game, Frostpunk's console port is a slick and efficient strategy game of misery and compromise in the coldest apocalypse. You could say it's the cold standard in console strategy."
Chris Hyde,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,Frostpunk Console Edition is the happiest I've been staring despair in the face. A fantastic city-builder where you really care about the people you're trying to save.
John-Paul Jones,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"A stellar societal strategy game with a dark, moralistic centre, Frostpunk is a rare genre effort where your actions linger with you long after your time with it has finished. This is tactical, though well-meaning nihilism at its best, and is an easy recommendation to those who want their grey matter tested as much as their heart."
John Cal McCormick,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"At its best, Frostpunk provides a tense, nail-biting experience like few others in the genre. It's not about building an empire, or creating a beautiful cityscape, but simply doing what you need to do to guide your people through what at first seems like insurmountable adversity. There's a few niggling issues, but the feeling you get from surviving the campaign is one of utter, unbridled joy, and it's that feeling more than any other why we have absolutely no qualms about recommending Frostpunk to you."
Lloyd Coombes,2019-03-14T04:00:00.000Z,Frostpunk is bleak. Really bleak.
Glenn Gugliotti,2018-07-05T04:00:00.000Z,"If you are into these non-combat/city building types of strategy games, I highly highly highly recommend Frostpunk. The gameplay is very engaging, the sound is amazing and the game is just stunning to look at. Just so you know, expect your people to die, because they will. So, so many of them will die."
James Ide,2018-07-03T04:00:00.000Z,"I thought I'd pretty much seen everything in the strategy gene and I'm delighted to say Frostpunk while hard and unforgiving is rewarding and a breathe of fresh frozen air to of the strategy genre, with and great story. Underneath the cold harsh tone, difficulty, and slightly tricky interface lie the warm beating heart of a strong and surprisingly deep game."
Mohammad Aria Moghaddam,2018-06-10T04:00:00.000Z,"Another amazing game from developers of This War of Mine. Beautiful story, challenging decisions, unique art style, variant gameplay mechanics and deep survival elements, made Frostpunk one of the best survival game of this generation and a must-have game for fans of deep dark challenging survival games. Don't miss it!"
Shahab Zareei,2018-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is both a fresh and intense experience in its genre. It is both a competent city-builder and an engaiging survivor game. Its beautiful art and music go very well with its settings and story. Your choices matter and each has its consequences, and pitch your senses of morality and reason against each other. The gameplay is challenging and fun by itself, yet new challenges are presented throughout the game to keep things fresh. The only downside is that these challenges lose their element of surprise after the first playthrough."
Alessandro Barbosa,2018-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is an ingenious blend of city building systems and morally ambiguous decision making. Its mechanics are streamlined enough to be easy to grasp, but it's tension and demanding nature make it an apocalyptic experience you shouldn't skip."
Robert Risdon,2018-05-23T04:00:00.000Z,"With dozens of different selections for technology research, an interesting and almost living personality to your city, and heaps of frozen trouble, FrostPunk will challenge every fiber of your strategic being and it. is. glorious. I am not entirely sure I can adequately define the addictive brutality found in FrostPunk as it is genius in its drive to freeze you out. FrostPunk is worth your time on every level … the visceral struggle of a lost people working their way through the frozen tundra is incredibly relatable and it is terrifying."
Ishan Dey,2018-05-21T04:00:00.000Z,"Frostpunk is extremely harsh with its dramatically dismal atmosphere, but its steampunk theme is aesthetically alluring and somewhat helps alleviate that."
James Wood,2018-05-20T04:00:00.000Z,The impact Frostpunk can have on the player is truly remarkable.
Sancho Canela,2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is a short game, but intense and very fun. Its playable proposal hooks and its duration is just so that it does not get heavy, although if your combat system catches you (which is very easy to happen) you will be wanting much more. The narrative is very good and is perfectly integrated into the development of the game, sometimes very evident and other times very subtle. It is an excellent game with few buts and really hard not to recommend. It compensates for its short duration with the intensity and quality of its hours."
Pedro Mesquita,2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is easily one of the finest works being made available in the Nintendo Switch catalogue. Fans of action games and of turn-based combat games will be delighted at this work, which will keep players very well entertained for a long time thanks to its long-lasting lifespan and to its fantastic soundtrack."
Jay Kittelson,2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,"With excellent music, beautifully drawn levels, and a story that jerks at the heartstrings, Transistor is a great game that will surely leave you satisfied and wanting to play through it a second time."
Justin Nation,2018-11-01T04:00:00.000Z,"Between the somewhat different way that its story and details reveal themselves, the terrific music and visuals, and the custom-catered abilities you’ll use in challenging combat Transistor is a satisfying cyberpunk romp. No matter how powerful you may feel the Process continues to send new enemies and scenarios at you so you’ll need to experiment and adapt, keeping everything engaging throughout. While the story feels like it’s over a bit too soon it’s a satisfying ride and if you want even more challenging combat you then always have the Sandbox and New Game + to indulge in."
William Gallon,2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z,"While there doesn't seem to be anything new to draw players in, Transistor has always had a goal of replayability to begin with.  Owning it on a Switch lets you play it both at home and on the go, rather than needing two versions of the game to do so.  Performance was great on both, and I spent a large amount of time playing through without even realizing it.  The game also does not have a Switch markup as many others do, so this is definitely worth a pick up if you haven't already got yourself sick of the game on another console."
Adam Abou-Nasr,2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,"But it's so damn short. Red's epic lasts just a few hours. New Game + promises to carry over my progress and beef up the Process accordingly, and the Sandbox still hides challenges, so there's replayability here. Still, I want more time with Red and her endearing sword. Transistor is too good to end so soon."
Chris Hinton,2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,"Supergiant has made it clear that stories are important to them. Players seeking a game with strategic combat and simply a great, unique story need not look any further than Transistor."
Mitch Vogel,2018-10-30T04:00:00.000Z,"Supergiant Games outdid itself with Transistor, providing an engaging ARPG experience that managed to improve upon its predecessor in many ways while adding in distinct new elements that help to define its identity. It's another welcome addition to the Switch library, and is the epitome of a modern RPG classic, with its fusion of cyberpunk elements, unconventional storytelling, and dynamic gameplay make for a game that you won't want to miss out on. We'd give Transistor a high recommendation to anybody looking for another great RPG for their Switch, or for someone who just wants to hear a good story."
Ewan Wilson,2015-10-18T04:00:00.000Z,"Like Blade Runner, Transistor may need a Director's Cut to achieve its full potential"
James Wynne,2014-12-27T05:00:00.000Z,"There's not a single area in which Transistor doesn't shine beautifully. It is objectively short and very linear which many will see as a negative, but it really works to make a tight package in Transistor's case."
Nate Kiernan,2014-07-11T04:00:00.000Z,Transistor left me floored.
Az Elias,2014-07-07T04:00:00.000Z,"Despite following in Bastion's footsteps, Transistor doesn't quite manage to deliver as compelling and memorable an experience, even though it has clearly been crafted with such heartfelt intent. Whilst the premise is full of mystery and intrigue, during the course of the short story it never really draws players in as it would have many people believe after its promising start. A case of style over substance, but still a game that deserves the attention of those after something original and rather beautiful - only wait till it goes on sale first."
Ben Ward,2014-07-02T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is a worthy follow up to one of the most revered indie games of the last generation. Supergiant have taken a formula that works really well and applied a truly gorgeous art direction to it, with an incredibly deep combat system to boot. It's a game that is well worth your time, and with the big AAA game drought heading our way over summer, it's a perfect title to sink your teeth into for a few hours and just let it wash over you."
James Darrall,2014-06-25T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is a beautiful, absorbing and well thought out game that encourages you to get creative with its system and carve out your own approach to defeating your opponents. Want superb aesthetics, compelling backstory and tactically engaging gameplay?  Look no further."
Randy Kalista,2014-06-24T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is one of my favorite games of the past year, easy. Without being weird and unrecognizable as a video game, Transistor turns many video game tropes on their heads—subtley. It also features an excellently written and likable narrator, a fully realized and meaningfully motivated female protagonist, a twist on the tired old tech tree of yore, a soundtrack that's integral to the storytelling fabric of the game, and a complex enemy composed of cowards, contemporaries, and anything-but-bloodthirsty rivals. There's not a note, pixel, or line of dialog out of place."
Matt Young,2014-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful, stylised and interesting. In a world of stale games Transistor takes all that was good from the loved Bastion but makes enough changes that it stand out on its own."
Jamie Frier,2014-06-16T04:00:00.000Z,"Just like the technical artifice in which it's set, though, it never quite feels like home."
Joe Morgan,2014-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is a beautiful game with a fun, addictive progression and combat systems."
Zhiqing Wan,2014-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,"With the emergence of Transistor and Child of Light from earlier this year, it's getting harder and harder to argue that video games are merely there for entertainment and have no artistic value at all. Transistor strikes a fine balance between being an enjoyable video game and a cyberpunk piece of art."
Nicholas Plouffe,2014-06-04T04:00:00.000Z,"While it has the capabilities, it probably won't appeal to those looking for twitch-action or puzzles. Still it deserves a chance to steal your heart, just as it stole mine. The only thing missing is more content."
Keri Honea,2014-06-02T04:00:00.000Z,"As pretty as the game looks and sounds, it just doesn't make up for shallow gameplay and a story that really fell flat for me in the end. At least I was able to complete it in six hours, so the tedium didn't last for that long."
Liam Croft,2014-06-01T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor gives players a dazzling world to explore, a customisable combat system that anyone could find pleasure in, and a story that can pull on even the toughest person's heartstrings if engaged with. Transistor is a worthy follow up to Bastion and it shows that Supergiant Games aren't finished with bringing truly jaw-dropping worlds to the videogame industry. The linearity and confusing opening hour do hinder the game somewhat, but as you come to understand Transistor, you'll be swept away by its charm and beauty."
Chris Selogy,2014-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,Supergiant Games has done a great job with their follow-up to the acclaimed Bastion by putting out a unique take on the strategy RPG genre that we haven’t seen since Valkyria Chronicles infused third-person shooter controls into the traditional strategy RPG mechanics.
Lance Liebl,2014-05-31T04:00:00.000Z,"When all is said and done, it's a perfect combination of gaming elements done right that you'll want to play again, all the while debating the realities of Cloudbank, its citizens and the Transistor."
Daniel Carreras,2014-05-30T04:00:00.000Z,"It may start off feeling pompous and arrogant, but give it enough time and you'll start to uncover a deeply sophisticated world, supported by a brilliant story, and solid, dynamic gameplay."
"Chris ""Atom"" DeAngelus",2014-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is an early contender for one of the most engaging games of the year. It isn't Bastion 2, since it's more of a straight RPG than an action game, and the tone, characters and setting are quite different. It manages to craft an engaging and exciting RPG experience mixed with a simple but curiously enticing story, and its biggest sin is being over too soon. It won't necessarily appeal to all of Bastion's fans, but Transistor shows that Supergiant Games isn't just a one-hit wonder and is capable of crafting an entirely different kind of game experience that is still exciting and delightful."
Morgan Bates,2014-05-29T04:00:00.000Z,"Overall Transistor certainly shows how far Supergiant Games have come from Bastion - which was a great effort. Unfortunately, it's missing some essential elements in an RPG (such as the aforementioned grinding) making a few bosses harder than they should be. Yet, as bad as those flaws may sound, I had a great time playing it thanks to the battle system, and the sheer charm of the characters. "
Joshua Murney,2014-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,"From it's intelligent game design to it's breathtaking art direction, Transistor brings the player into a world bursting with creativity. I found myself immediately entering New Game Plus mode after the credits rolled because I didn't want to leave the world of Cloudbank. Transistor is a game that isn't afraid to go outside of typical video game tropes resulting in a refreshing and fun experience. This is easily one of the best games on the PS4 and one PC gamers should consider."
Cody Long,2014-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,"Is Transistor worth your time? Well, I'm here to say that yes, it absolutely is. Stunning visuals, heart-breaking but well-written narrative (with a few rushed bits here and there), brilliant sound design, and a fun and rewarding battle system are some of the things you'll be signing up for if you purchase this game. And for a paltry twenty dollar pricetag (or your regional equivalent), you could do a hell of a lot worse. Transistor is a moody, atmospheric, tragic love story, and it's absolutely wonderful. A few pitfalls keep it from being perfect, but I'd still recommend it to anyone who loves games."
Ben Dutka,2014-05-28T04:00:00.000Z,"All in all, the stellar concept and artistic style of Transistor is nigh-on unparalleled. The mystical aura surrounding and permeating the entire game is original and attractive, the blending of real-time and turn-based gameplay is inspired (and yeah, it works exceedingly well), and there's a surprising amount of humanity injected into this otherwise sci-fi presentation. I don't like some of the stumbling blocks they purposely throw in your way, as they speak more to the action side of the game (and I prefer the strategic side), and above all else, the potential of the game is just so much…more."
Trevor Ruben,2014-05-27T04:00:00.000Z,"Of Supergiant's two games, 'Transistor' is second-best. I'll always commend a studio for opting to be different, and in some ways it pays off for Supergiant, while in others it doesn't. The combat system is compelling at first, but generally not balanced enough to compel me to keep going in a second playthrough. The story is at first mysterious but eventually underwhelming, despite a strong emotional core in its two lead characters, and the city of Cloudbank shines brightly in just one way, and so feels dull after about an hour."
Will Borger,2014-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,"Transistor is a fantastic follow-up to Bastion that features incredible art design, wonderful music, deep, customizable, strong storytelling and one of the best plots in recent memory. It's a thoughtful, beautiful, and well-designed game that should be played by everyone with a passing interest in RPGs. Go buy it. Now."
Andrew Dyce,2014-05-26T04:00:00.000Z,"It may seem less of a fairy tale, but it's still one accomplished story. And with gameplay that is both approachable and engaging without sacrificing depth, the team at Supergiant have shown that they're just getting started."
Bill Hess,2014-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,"While the combat system itself is the real star of Transistor, Red's journey through Cloudbank is definitely one worth taking."
Aaron Riccio,2014-05-25T04:00:00.000Z,"As in Bastion, you'll gain the option of increasing the difficulty in exchange for more experience, and the soundtrack and narration is surprisingly on par with the previously high bar set by Supergiant Games."
Adam Byrne,2014-05-24T04:00:00.000Z,"The enticing narrative, interlaced with gripping story-mechanics, all culminating in a fittingly poignant finale make Transistor a game that deserves to find its home in as many PlayStation 4's as possible."
Adam Standing,2014-05-23T04:00:00.000Z,"Before playing I didn't expect to be fully enraptured by Transistor, thinking the spectre of Bastion would haunt the experience too much. But neither did I expect Transistor to take that formula and evolve it into something so sublime and handcrafted that tears would roll down my cheek as the credits rolled. From its combat mechanics and customisation, to the narrative and the visually orgasmic art-style, this is an experience to be savoured, to lock yourself away in the confines of your gaming boudoir and revel in its luxurious design and perfection."
Jesse Norris,2021-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"At full price I would say make sure you know exactly what this game is before buying it. It’s excellent, but this genre isn’t going to be for everyone. On Game Pass though this one is a no-brainer to give a try. The install size isn’t huge, but the amount of high-quality content contained within is."
Nick Pace,2020-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Dust off them saddles and check out this review for Desperados III on PC! A real-time tactics experience set in the Old West; the challenging gameplay will test even the fastest gunslingers. Despite its reliance on standard tropes, this game is dynamite."
Jason Stettner,2020-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is a generally great tactical game, it provides a brutal western environment to explore and gives you the freedom to tackle situations how you please."
Dave  Rodriguez,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III builds off Mimimi Games recent history, and breathes new life into a classic series."
Martin Bago,2020-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III offers an excellent western setting and thoughtful tactical gameplay. If you won't get discouraged by the amount of early failures, you'll be rewarded with the sweet taste of victory. Even there isn't many tactical strategy games, Desperados III is one of the best."
Tim Bissinger,2020-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,Sneak instead of shoot: Desperados III is surprisingly restrained with shoot-outs and classic Wild West action. The bottom line is that it takes over too many features from Shadow Tactics and thus distances itself quite a bit from the core of the template - but it's still really good real-time tactics that will still be fun in 2020.
Ken McKown,2020-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"There is a lot to love about Desperados III, but it is worth noting that the game is not forgiving. It will take time and patience to push through its massive campaign."
Andreas Salmen,2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"If you have thick skin and an unquenched desire to solve stealth puzzles in the Wild West, Desperados III is the best real-time tactical stealth game that I have played in a long, long time."
Nikos Papakonstantinou,2020-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The tools that are offered to the player and the level design, give a plethora of approaches that reward patience and ingenuity."
Brendan Quinn,2020-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,Desperadoes III is a highly-addictive and engaging real-time tactics game that offers endlessly satisfying experimentation and replay value
Chase Ferrin,2020-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is one of the best real time tactics games to come out in years. Fun and strategic gameplay, a diverse cast of characters with their own unique abilities, and some top-tier level design are just a few of the things the game has going for it. It’s honestly some of the most fun I’ve had all year and I hardly noticed the time passing while I was playing."
Muhammad Ali Bari,2020-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is a faithful return for the series, occasionally to a fault but often to great success. It’ll please fans of strategy games but won’t make a fan out of those that aren’t."
Bronwyn James,2020-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"I struggle to find much negative to say about the game as a whole, even after it deleted several hours worth of hard won levels. Had it happened more than once, I’d be frustrated beyond belief, but considering how much I enjoyed everything else, I can forgive one mishap."
Lewis Langton,2020-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Well howdy, partner, I am Woody, and this is the Wild West… Oops, wrong game. Welcome to the Wild West and get ready to go up against bandits and corrupt businessmen as you fight through the world of western times."
Dylan Blight,2020-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Desperados III is simply one of the best stealth games can play right now.
Damien Booth,2020-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"This game comes with the highest of recommendations – if you see Desperados III, be sure to grab it – it’s absolutely well worth it!"
David Wildgoose,2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,Desperados 3 is an elegant stealth tactics game that encourages experimentation.
Matin Nasiri,2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is an interesting and high-quality tactical game in the Wild West. The gameplay and game mechanics are at their best, and along with the interesting story and lovable characters, it will keep players entertained for hours."
Jan Kalný,2020-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados 3 might not be a huge revolution in the real-time stealth action genre at first glance. And, in fact, it's not. What it is, however, is an incredibly robust game that will keep you on your toes, will make you feel smart and - especially - will entertain you from start to finish."
Connor Trinske,2020-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is a masterclass in real-time tactics, full of clever challenges, countless possibilities, and old inconveniences of the genre."
Andrew McMahon,2020-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"While it may not be for everyone, I encourage those who are frustrated to mess with things first before giving up on it entirely, as it’s an excellent example of a game you should give time to gestate."
Lilith Jewett,2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is the kind of game that prioritizes fun above all else, and it manages to do so without sacrificing the oomph of its story or depth of its mechanics."
Cosmin Vasile,2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"This is maybe one of the greatest merits of Desperados III, even when it makes you sweat and go back to the drawing board, it remains fun and never becomes a dull repetition of the same actions. Although the price tag is not of a AAA game, the content it offers makes it an experience you should not miss. If you were a fan of the original game, Desperados III is the sequel you have been waiting for since 2001."
Jose A. Rodríguez,2020-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,‎Excellent game full of risk situations that will have to be solved through a very technical game system.‎
João Canelo,2020-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,A blast from de past.
Lucas Moura,2020-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III builds heavily upon Mimimi Games “Shadow Tactics” experience to deliver one of the best “soft reboots” I’ve seen in a long while. It’s unrelentless and both charming varied enough to keep you going. It knows how to treat “failure” not as a bad thing, but only a minor setback. Heavily recommended for stealth fans."
Adam Rorke,2020-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados 3 is a sensational game that boasts challenging game design that is as equally rewarding as it is frustrating. With an engaging story, interesting characters, and a great setting, it’s easy to recommend this game to just about everyone"
Jamie Laike Tsui,2020-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,A fantastic ode to cowboy films combined with challenging and satisfying gameplay.
Иван Бышонкoв,2020-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Mimimi Games once again proved itself as a modern king of the stealth tactics genre. However, Desperados III is dangerously similar to the Shadow Tactics and heavily relies on the ideas of the previous game."
Ben Thomas,2020-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is a great tactical stealth game with five diverse characters traversing through large open levels with alternate routes that enhance replay value. Picking off patrols and executing multiple actions works marvelously through both the swamps and the frontier towns. And with high quality presentation, this is one entry that fans of the genre shouldn't miss."
Alberto Morales Palencia,2020-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados III is an extremely polished, cleverly posed, and highly engaging tactical game that deserves a spot in any fan of the genre's library."
,,
Marcus Estrada,2020-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,Desperados III is a downright fantastic real-time tactics title.
Darren Pearce,2020-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Desperados 3 is the leader of the pack in this genre. A quality game, tight controls, excellent story and addictive puzzle-based gameplay that rewards creative thinking when you clear an area of bad folks."
Matt Sainsbury,2020-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Building on Mimimi Games' success with Shadow Tactics, Desperados III is mature, confident gameplay design, and while it might not look like an AAA-blockbuster, it certainly has the level of refinement and quality that is a rare thing indeed. It could have been a little more in places, but it's a solid, intelligent depiction of a beloved part of America's narrative heritage and aesthetic, with some excellent and creative tactical puzzles to sort through along the way."
A.J. Maciejewski,2020-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"If you're looking for a highly enjoyable experience that's undoubtedly something different, Desperados III will provide hours of gunslinging good times. Plus, those who enjoy perfecting their strategies as they take a trial and error approach will absolutely love it."
C J Lehr,2021-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a challenging and gorgeous game. I love finding new creatures, and they even change with the in-game “seasons”. Frankly, I can’t see how this game could possibly get boring since I am enjoying myself so much, and because I have a lot of story and environment left to discover,

I have decided to do a short series of articles as I continue playing through this title. Look for upcoming “Summer in Subnautica” articles if you want to follow my underwater journey!"
Alberto Martin,2021-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a universe where we lose ourselves for hours creating our own world and learning to live with our environment in a fight for survival that is both exciting and relaxing: a unique experience that you should not miss and that will catch you: How a wave, Subnautica is rocking the player and makes it impossible for us to escape from its waters"
Dan Twohig,2021-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,"While Subnautica remains a brilliantly immersive and addictive survival adventure, the PS5 upgrade delivers less than we expected. Technically, the game is very similar to its successor, Subnautica: Below Zero, and yet falls short on both performance and visual quality in comparison. A free upgrade is always welcome, but perhaps Subnautica PS5 has automatically been made redundant by its superior sequel. Existing Subnautica players with a PS5 get a nice facelift, but there's little to justify this edition for newcomers."
John Rairdin,2021-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a survival and narrative experience that stands as a benchmark for the genre. The Switch version itself certainly has its drawbacks, but not enough to weigh down the experience too much. Some of them do admittedly affect gameplay mildly, but the strength of Subnautica still pushes through."
Ralph Panebianco,2020-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,Quote not yet available.
Nicola Ardron,2019-01-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is not without its issues, but it successfully manages to combine a strong sense of exploration and discovery with an interesting story hook and an exceptional soundtrack to make it one of the very best examples of the genre."
Nathan Carter,2019-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,"Aside from a few technical issues, Subnautica is one of the best survival games out there. Not only is the world to explore beautiful but the narrative will keep pulling you along,"
Gabriel Carli,2019-01-06T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a survival horror game that should be one of the best of all time, but its optimization harms it drastically. It's immersive, has a chaotic story, enjoyable visuals, incredible sound effects and gameplay that gets almost everything right."
Daniel Young,2018-12-29T05:00:00.000Z,Unknown Worlds Entertainment have crafted a truly unique underwater adventure/survival title and I am very excited for when they release Subnautica: Below Zero.
Alberto Rocha,2018-12-24T05:00:00.000Z,Subnautica is a very solid example of the best survival games in recent years.
Andrew Ogley,2018-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,"If you're into resource gathering, crafting and exploring, then Subnautica is simply a title that you have to play. "
Martin Patiño,2018-12-20T05:00:00.000Z,Subnautica is one of the better and relatively unique takes on the open-world survival genre that not only executes its expected features well but also provides new ones that help it stand out among its competitors.
Nicole Hall,2018-12-17T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica sees you submerged in a vast and utterly breathtaking underwater world, teeming with secrets and polished off with an unsettling atmosphere that instigates a real sense of thrill as you play. "
Rob Gordon,2018-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is something different in the survival genre, with a well-crafted underwater world providing some variety to its hunter-gatherer gameplay."
Edgar Wulf,2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,"While it’s by no means a perfect game, the sheer aspect of exploration more than makes up for it and potentially offers hours upon hours of pure fun"
Brendan Lowry,2018-12-10T05:00:00.000Z,"Despite the performance issues, Subnautica is definitely a title that you shouldn't sleep on. The open world exploration and survival mechanics are on point, and the world is massive, deep, and rich in detail; it's just a shame that it's being held back a little bit by problems with how it runs.

"
Steve Farrelly,2018-12-07T05:00:00.000Z,"I honestly hope this becomes a longstanding series, it's simply that good."
Jack McCaskill,2018-12-06T05:00:00.000Z,"A survival game that manages to balance a driving plot without sacrificing player agency. Constantly balanced on the knife edge of life and watery death. Subnautica is a game with hidden depths, both literally and figuratively."
Florian Zandt,2018-12-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica turns out to be a true hit, only the occasional grind cuts the groud under its feet a little bit."
Alex Avard,2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,"Performance problems aside, Subnautica will rekindle your faith in the overcrowded survival genre, and scare you senseless."
Blake Grundman,2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,"If you couldn't tell, I was blown away by Subnautica. What initially appeared to be a knee-high kiddie pool worth of depth, suddenly gives way to a literal ocean of gameplay opportunities. And while it has certain technical limitations, these are certainly not going to discourage the non-critic audience from at least dipping a toe in. It's easily one of the coolest, engaging, and most gratifying experiences I've had with a game in 2018. Come on in! The water's fine."
Roberto Turrini,2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a survival game worthy of competing with the most noble titles of the same genre. The PS4 version has a bunch of technical issues (loading times and frame rate above all), but nothing that can undermine the gaming experience."
Rebecca Stow,2018-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a perfect example an open world survival game that doesn't rely on action, horror or combat elements to excite. Whilst these classic gaming features are involved to an extent, they take a back seat compared to the story, crafting and surviving elements. And this is what sets Subnautica apart from other survival experiences out there. Don't let this be the one that got away."
Jesús Díaz-Suelto Berrueco,2018-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is postulated as a standout among the survival genre. Offering the player clarity and a storyline to guide the experience, find a place among my personal Olympus of games dedicated to weathering the storm when we are abandoned in a desolate place."
Taylor Hidalgo,2018-05-17T04:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is a beautiful game, only occasionally marred by sluggishness and the odd, errant bug."
Robert N. Adams,2018-03-01T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is an underwater survival game with a compelling narrative, although some design choices, oversights, and bugs hampered my enjoyment of the title."
Scott Ellison II,2018-02-16T05:00:00.000Z,"With over 40 hours in Subnautica, I have cannot recommend the game more. I enjoyed the crafting, base building, and survival elements based on the difficulty I chose. At no point did I feel like I was ever safe, though, as the underwater tranquility can make you feel that way. Even if you don’t like survival games, playing Subnautica is likely to change your mind, and show you that it is not like others you’ve played before. The narrative threads that string you along Subnautica‘s story are intriguing from moment one as you unravel it so carefully. Unknown Worlds have made an incredible game that subverts expectations of what a crafting and survival game have been, and shows you what they should be."
Ben Dye,2018-02-13T05:00:00.000Z,"If you enjoy exploring for the sake of exploring then you'll likely enjoy your time with the game, but otherwise this is a title to pass on and never look back at."
Clayton Daley,2018-02-12T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica also features the single best soundtrack I've heard in the last 5 years. Every track is crafted with care, fits the area and environment. I honestly felt there was someone adapting the music to my every move."
Jack Bampfield,2018-02-09T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is one of the original Early Access triumphs, and in my view, the best of them all."
Elise Favis,2018-02-06T05:00:00.000Z,"With a robust crafting system and several amazing secrets to find, Subnautica never ceases to entertain"
Mario Baccigalupi,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"In terms of settings, gameplay dynamics and sheer fascination, Subnautica is the best single-player survival game out there. It's full of bright discoveries, a great sci-fi experience, and at the same time a cruel and unforgiving survival horror. James Cameron would absolutely love it."
Alireza Mahzoon,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,"Without any doubt, Subnautica is one the best existing games in survival genre; a game whose developers leave you alone in the center of an endless ocean to struggle for surviving, uncovering secrets, and finally finding a way to escape. After releasing of Subnautica, the survival genre lovers do not need any other game for a long time."
Ben Thomas,2018-02-05T05:00:00.000Z,Subnautica links progression to dive depth and it pays dividends. It also provides useful tools and varied submersibles that facilitate the steady exploration of wondrous biomes far below the waves.
Francesco De Meo,2018-02-03T05:00:00.000Z,"Subnautica is one of the best survival games released in recent years, and one of the best indie games released in the beginning of 2018. With an interesting story, a variety of play modes that can tone down and completely remove survival elements and plenty of freedom in how to proceed, Subnautica is a game that can also be enjoyed by those who aren't particularly fond of the genre."
Jesse Norris,2022-02-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is an excellent game. It goes up just under Hades for me as one of the best examples of the genre. Having it release day one into Game Pass this is a game you should give a try if it appeals at all to you. Solid gameplay, excellent build diversity, charming graphics, and a heartfelt story combine to make something wonderful that should be experienced by as many people as possible."
Mitch Vogel,2022-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper really is rather good; this is a game that certainly deserves more attention than it’s received. What it lacks in originality, it makes up for in heart. A surprisingly emotional story, rewarding progression system, snappy combat, and painterly visuals make for an experience that we’d suggest you give a serious look."
Kirstie Summers,2021-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is a randomly generated dungeon crawler with fun combat, breath-taking design and a premise that is both moving and expertly woven into the mechanics and structure of the game."
Eric Ace,2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"For an unknown studio they come out swinging pretty good with Dreamscaper, the core game is fairly engaging and interesting, but the core loop has some serious progression issues, as well as bad difficulty balance. Trying new moves and weapons is the highlight of the experience, but the very slow lack of progress and difficulty walls hold this back from being truly great."
Emanuele Feronato,2021-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"In a crowded roguelike landscape, Dreamscaper tries to stand out by adding a narrative, advendure-like mini section, which is so well-crafted and interesting that it almost overshadows the action segments. The game offers good graphics and a cool soundtrack, but also repetitive puzzles and unconvincing enemy design. Luckily, the combat system is excellent, which makes a great pick for any action roguelike fan."
Ville Kovanen,2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"""Action-heavy roguelite with a thoughtful story."""
Suhyung Jung,2021-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,Dreamscaper is a rogue-lite game with an attractive story. It also has excellent actions and upgrade systems.
Callum Rakestraw,2021-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper rewards patience. It may not have immediately pulled me in, but sticking with it was ultimately worth it. In part because the wait wasn’t huge, but also because the majority of my time with it has been worthwhile. It’s a very satisfying game to play once it finds its rhythm. Roguelikes are a crowded genre with plenty of games vying for attention, and Dreamscaper is one definitely worth your attention."
Heidi Hawes,2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is an amazing indie gem and is an easy recommendation for fans of roguelikes/lites. Much like with Hades, the combat is fun with an addictive gameplay loop, plus the fact that the story gets deeper and more is revealed as you play will keep you wanting to come back for more. Each time I dive in I have a hard time putting the game down."
James Luff,2021-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is a delightful rogue-lite that is worth sinking hours and hours into if you are a fan of this genre. Beautiful graphics, engaging combat and a constant trickle of content easily overcome the small niggles I had with this game. A great game to play in long or short bursts that I found hard to put down. Just don’t stay up too late playing it. Sleep is very important. Sweet dreams."
Daniel Tack,2021-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is a subtle, surreal ARPG that features compelling combat, engaging progression systems, and enchanting environments. If you enjoy roguelikes, don't miss it"
Scott Baird,2021-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is a game of contrasts and not all of the elements are cohesive. It combines the incredible gameplay loops of Hades and Persona 5, but wraps them in a slice-of-life package that doesn't quite fit them in properly. Weak characters and story aside, however, Dreamscaper is a great roguelike and worth checking out for fans of the genre all the same."
Jonathan Logan,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper has been in early access for about a year, and based on my time with it, I can say that time was well spent by Afterburner. They’ve created a well-balanced and engaging roguelike Action RPG that perfectly pairs with its social simulator mechanics. I continued to play long after I conquered Cassidy’s dreams and enjoyed every run, whether it was all the way to the end of the game or stupidly dying in the first level. This is a super impressive debut for the studio, and I hope that Afterburner is already working on its follow-up title! If Dreamscaper is any indication, we will be in for some sweet dreams ahead!"
Rob Larkin,2021-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper combines solid gameplay elements and narrative in an excellent and carefully crafted adventure. While there are occasional difficulty jumps that break the loop, there are mechanics to put things back together and push onward in a journey of discovery and heart. It's a good roguelike outright that also succeeds weaving in storytelling that most games are often too fearful to even try."
Quinn Hiers,2021-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is a fun rouge-lite that offers hours upon hours of fun and novel gameplay. While the combat is entertaining and offers a variety that’ll never get boring, the way the game focuses on mental health is well-done and powerful because of it."
Issa Maki,2021-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,Afterburner Studios enters the gaming world with a very strong roguelite that has the gameplay to rival its ambition.
A.J. Maciejewski,2021-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"There are many excellent indie games recently and you can definitely add Dreamscaper to the list. With its pitch-perfect game world, highly rewarding gameplay loop, imaginative premise, and personal boss fights; you'll regret sleeping on this one."
Josh Speer,2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"I appreciated the time I spent with Dreamscaper, and I think Afterburner Studios is a team to watch. If you’re a fan of roguelikes and don’t mind a steep challenge, I’d definitely check Dreamscaper out."
Tyler Chancey,2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,Dreamscaper combines the polished gameplay and progression of a rogulike to tell a more grounded character-driven story with aplomb.
Pierre-Yves Lanthier,2021-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"So from the Prologue to Early Access and then to full release, Afterbuner Studios’ Dreamscaper has been an amazing adventure. With multiple easy to use systems, an intuitive combat system and plenty of upgrades to be discovered and unlocked, there’s more than enough dungeon crawling and rogueliting to keep anyone busy for a long while. If it gets too easy? Just add in some extra modifiers and see if you’re still swinging the same tune or getting kicked out of the record store for not knowing what Math Rock was."
Lucas White,2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"The literature tells you you’re getting stronger and doing well, so do the people around you. But is that something you can perceive in the thick of it? All you can do is take it a day at a time, and do what you can. Am I talking about the game or real life? That question shows us Dreamscaper’s success at its thematic goals."
Alex Fuller,2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"While the gameplay provides a strong loop that makes it easy to jump in, it’s the immersive atmosphere that grabs hold and keeps players engaged for multiple runs. The emotional struggles of the characters resonate, and there are important messages about how helpful the support of others can be."
Dominick Ashtear,2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper was a rich, deep, intimate experience through the mind of a person suffering under the weight of her trauma. The gameplay and the story serve each other in a way that's rare to see in video games. There are a ton of little touches that make it a joy to play, and I found myself wanting to learn more about Cassidy and what happened to her after her sister died. While not everything wound up being a home run, I enjoyed the game overall. I'm grateful to the team at Afterburner for this sometimes satisfying, sometimes painful piece of art."
Sina Golabzade,2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,Dreamscaper doesn’t try to do anything new but it does everything in a pretty satisfying fashion but it lacks a degrees of depth in the combat and social interaction systems to make it a truly memorable experience.
Farley Santos,2021-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper uses dreams and emotional issues to create a great dungeon crawling adventure with roguelite elements. Fast-paced battles are exciting with its wide range of skills that allow you to create numerous interesting combinations. In addition, there is a lot of creativity with various powers out of the ordinary and accentuated challenge, which made me keep trying even after being defeated countless times. The stages are somewhat similar to each other, even with procedural generation, and some points in the battle system are truncated, but, overall, the experience is immersive. Other than that, there is an interesting fragmented narrative about a girl with emotional trauma facing relatable situations developed in two gameplay moments that constantly influence each other in a great way — the actions taken while the heroine is awake expand the dream dungeons, and vice versa. A great looking atmosphere, soft music and surreal tone make exploration a pleasure. In the end, Dreamscaper is a remarkable and captivating experience."
Emily Byrnes,2020-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is a deep, thought-provoking journey packed with some truly enjoyable combat and realistic characters. If you’ve been hesitating to give it a try-don’t."
Dewan Zawad,2020-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Afterburner Studio did one thing, which is to be appreciated, the players are given a chance to experience exclusive Cassidy’s skin, exclusive weapon skin, and retro model."
Chase Ferrin,2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"I wouldn’t say that this is a bad game, but it’s also not a game I can honestly recommend, at least in its current state. There’s obviously a good base here, but a lot of the core game elements just don’t have the depth that they really need to warrant playing the game while its in Early Access."
Mick Fraser,2020-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Dreamscaper is beautiful, deep and haunting, deftly combining elements of real-life pain and poignant character development with fast-paced combat in a surreal alternate world"
Ben Sheene,2018-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"In an increasingly busier time for the roguelite genre of tunneling further into a game's loop, Dreamscaper is a surprising breath of fresh air, using a grounded tale of anxiety and loss as a catalyst for fantastical beasts and familiar mechanics."
Benjamine Branscum,2018-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,It's a moving and relatable narrative that allows you inside our protagonist's life and personal experiences of her subconscious. It's a damn good game.
Justin Nation,2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine encompasses most of the difficulties you’d expect from the survival genre and throws on a pretty grim and depressing layer of reality to boot. The tests here aren’t just of your ability to figure out what the best crafting paths or things to prioritize in gathering may be but also of your ability to manage very human problems as well. There will be many ways the game can frustrate you as you try to figure out how to survive in this bleak situation but it’s the glimmers of hope, small successes, and human stories in this horrible situation that also make it memorable."
Jop van der Steen,2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,This War of Mine is setting up an unique setting and does this very well. Unfortunately sometimes the game feels a bit repetitive.
Evan Norris,2018-11-28T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is an important game, but not necessarily a good one."
José L. Ortega,2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine Complete Edition for Nintendo Switch is a game that reflects the crudity of war like no other. It is not intense or spectacular at the visual level, but it is capable of transmitting like few others, putting us in the shoes of survivors trying to survive with difficulty in the middle of a warlike conflict."
David Lloyd,2018-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,"As you begin to learn more about the systems with each passing day, it's easy not to notice real-world minutes turn into hours. I found myself restarting a campaign quite often after discovering a new strategy and my enjoyment increased each time. This is definitely one of those games that if you play late at night, you might just find yourself trading in some sleep to get through just one more day."
Rob Kershaw,2018-04-15T04:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is possibly something many gamers *should* experience for a few hours, but would they enjoy any part of it? That’s a completely different question."
John-Paul Jones,2016-06-17T04:00:00.000Z,A recommended expansion for fans of the original.
Emily Sowden,2015-07-23T04:00:00.000Z,"Every now and again we like losing because then when we win it's the sweetest victory, though with This War of Mine it probably wouldn't feel like a victory at all"
Alex Varankou,2015-02-23T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine successfully blends exploration, stealth, crafting and survivor management in a bleak setting. As most games in the genre however, the gameplay becomes mundane after you've established a winning formula."
Steven McCullough,2015-01-22T05:00:00.000Z,"Whether you choose to perceive it through a moral lens or not, there's a great tactical survival mechanic driving this game beneath the didactics."
Levi van Tine,2015-01-21T05:00:00.000Z,"'This War of Mine' is one of the best PC releases I've played from 2014. It is not empowering like other games. It's very difficult, and the first couple of playthroughs especially can be frustrating. It's also poignant and lets players tell their own stories without a heavy script or distracting voice acting. It might make you sad, but it's worth experiencing."
Matt Gardner,2015-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,"A deeply atmospheric, emotionally compelling game that manages to treat war as a serious topic and examines the hard choices made by those caught in the middle of conflict. You might not particularly enjoy your time with This War Of Mine, but it's definitely a game you ought to play, being one of the finest critiques of war that this medium has to offer."
"Uros ""Vader"" Pavlovic",2015-01-09T05:00:00.000Z,"Real-life problems and real-life challenges. Nobody's gonna hold your hand. You have to fight for yourself and to protect the ones you care about. This War of Mine is a brave endeavor. We see wonders done with this game in a potential sequel; one that will hopefully get a bigger budget, so we can see the genre evolve even more."
Jonathan Gordon,2014-12-28T05:00:00.000Z,An effective lesson on the casualties of war
Shaun Joy,2014-12-25T05:00:00.000Z,"A rewarding experience that will test your moral system, and brings a whole new narrative of war for people to listen to."
Jeff Kintner,2014-12-22T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine delivers a setting that is depressing and unsettling. It's a slow-paced resource management strategy game that will hang over you long after you walk away from it. Admittedly, it tip-toes into being melodramatic at times, and the controls could benefit from some hotkeys to back up the point-and-click interface. But the mechanics and setting are so well done, it's an absolute must play for anyone looking for an example of how all the different parts of a game can come together to create an affecting and immersive experience for a player."
Sam Welch,2014-12-14T05:00:00.000Z,"Of course, a great deal of impressive work went into the stylised visual of This War of Mine that might not have gone into something destined for a school computer or a museum plaque. Its pencil-shaded graphics touchingly evoke political cartoons and the dreary, dark colour palate of so much war art to sap life and hope from your course of events. Generally in games, the wonderful efforts put into visuals are to add to your enjoyment, but This War of Mine is instead making use of the medium of art to help put its message across - simultaneously establishing a valid place of its own within. This War of Mine blurs the boundaries of artistic and educational exhibition and in doing so demonstrates, significantly, how effortlessly the medium of videogames can lend itself to much more than entertainment, but if you're looking for fun, you've come to the wrong place. The message here is how fragile humanity can be when the comforts of modern society disappear and a question: Do 'good' and 'bad' choices exist, or just survival of the most ruthless? It's hard to score This War of Mine as a game, because you can't win it. You can survive with enough selfish tact. You can also be more community spirited at your own expense, but then if you die will the community fail without you around anyway? This is a poignant and reflective experience, thought through with meticulous depth. The gameplay is very simple, and that's probably deliberate too - the amount of thrill you get playing it will depend on what kind of beast you are."
Danny Adams,2014-12-11T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is a fun, uniquely stylish and well-written game that gives players a fresh take on an old setting and asks them to try and survive."
Hayden Dingman,2014-12-09T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine conveys some horrific truths about civilian life during warfare, and it does so in a way that only video games can accomplish."
Michael Huber,2014-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is a powerful and intimate portrayal of war through the eyes of ordinary civilians. An immense weight is put on the value of human life and moral decisions that can put your own well-being at risk. It's a thoughtful and heavy game, but one that's well worth playing."
Christopher Byrd,2014-12-08T05:00:00.000Z,"Though I certainly believe that video games are an art form, there are precious few games that I would hold up as works of art, which for me – in its narrative varieties at least – has something to do with extending one's capacity for empathy or adding depth to one's sense of the human condition.  On both counts ""This War of Mine"" succeeds."
Chaz Miller,2014-12-04T05:00:00.000Z,"If I'm being entirely honest, This War of Mine is one of the best all-around games I've played all year. A crisp, consistent atmosphere, intuitive gameplay, and surprising depth create a fantastic experience."
Daniel Tack,2014-12-02T05:00:00.000Z,"Effectively delivers a strong message about the depressing reality of war, eschewing classic soldier or commander glorification that permeates many games. An emotional, impactful journey, even if the gameplay elements are somewhat simple"
Brian Connor,2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,"In terms of gameplay I found This War of Mine a little tedious and slow. I mostly wanted to hustle through the gameplay parts so I could see the story and my characters develop. It's not an amazing GAME, but it's an amazing experience."
Cassidee Moser,2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z,"Using the interactive nature of a video game to great effect, This War of Mine brilliantly conveys this message by forcing the player to not only witness it, but to live it, experience it, and suffer through it firsthand."
Stephanie Tang,2014-11-30T05:00:00.000Z,"Where Spec Ops: The Line made me question being The Good Guy, this game made me question just how far off the reservation I was willing to go to preserve life."
Chaz Neeler,2014-11-29T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is a depressing look into how civilians caught in the midst of a war have to survive. It's hard, remorseless and soul-crushingly depressing, but it's also a must play game."
Alex Hamilton,2014-11-26T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine's mechanics are so well polished that you will find yourself playing into the early hours of the morning continually thinking ""just one more night"", ""just one more improvement"". Everything from the atmosphere to the characters to the gameplay is presented in a unique and fantastic way."
Darryn Bonthuys,2014-11-25T05:00:00.000Z,"The reality of war, hammered home through stark visuals and tight resource management, in a game where just surviving another day is winning."
Martin Robinson,2014-11-24T05:00:00.000Z,"Perhaps the problem is my own, and maybe I'm too content to morbidly tinker with my survivors to push them towards another miserable day. This War of Mine is a game whose simple message - that war is hell, and that we're all capable of being sucked into its moral depths - might be slightly compromised by its strengths as a game, but at least it's a message carried with a great deal more conviction than other, more bombastic portrayals of conflict. That, for certain, is something to be thankful for."
Jim Sterling,2014-11-24T05:00:00.000Z," What truly sets This War of Mine apart is its dignity. It doesn't trade in its message for cheap cry-bait, and it doesn't batter you senseless with its despondency. Don't expect to be presented two dramatically contrasting, woefully transparent choices and then watch the game preen itself over how clever it's been. You'll be dropped into a blighted world and be left to figure out your own path, making fatal mistakes and incurring tragic losses before coming to the conclusion that precious few videogames have ever had the nerve to draw…"
Dennis Scimeca,2014-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine tries to give us the barest taste of what it might be like to be trapped behind the lines of a war, with our entire world crumbling all around us. If that feels uncomfortable, if it is no fun whatsoever, the developers have accomplished precisely what they intended to."
Gil Almogi,2014-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,"Frankly, for all the artistic encounters I've had and valued as a gamer, this crosses a major threshold, delivering a valuable experience that doesn't seek to coddle a player's fragile conceptions of purpose and fun. If the lasting impression you receive is unquestionably bleak, you're doing it right. Nobody's going to reward you for even doing that."
Rob Zacny,2014-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is a gripping survival sim, and a great study of survival during wartime and civil collapse."
Reid McCarter,2014-11-23T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine manages to convey an important message very well. By turning the player into an active participant in the cutthroat rationale of life as an ordinary person attempting to survive a warzone, it encourages a level of empathy only possible through interaction. Instead of simply hearing the stories of people who suffer unimaginable hardship as civilians during war, the audience is asked to inhabit these narratives. When our choices became their choices—as completely awful as they may be—we can better understand the ground-level tragedies taking place across the globe at this moment. 11 bit Studios' greatest success with This War of Mine, it turns out, is in creating a videogame that is profoundly unpleasant to experience."
Matt Liebl,2014-11-22T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is an eye-opening experience that offers a refreshing, albeit bleak take on war. It's so easy to glorify war these days that you forget about those who are really impacted by it -- This War of Mine is a much-needed reminder of that."
Niko DelValle,2014-11-20T05:00:00.000Z,"This War of Mine is one of the most emotionally investing games I've played in years, and it doesn't need a complex set of gameplay systems to be what it is… a great game, and a deep piece of art on the horrors of war. A depiction of things so cruel and of life so horrible that you couldn't imagine these things actually happening, even if you know they do."
Zachary Atwood,2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 does what a good sequel should. It capitalizes on the best parts of its predecessors while providing new content and mechanics to advance the franchise. While the story structure and level design are largely the same, added weapons, more build depth, and new combat mechanics all enhance what the game has to offer. It doesn't always hit the mark perfectly, but it's a solid addition to the series. And let's face it, being a samurai is awesome."
Alexander Kremer,2020-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 leaves me very divided. The combat system is extensive, varied and is one of the best I've experienced in action role-playing games so far. Besides, the hunt for better equipment and armor sets is just as motivating as in Diablo or Destiny. The bosses are originally designed and many have interesting mechanics. But then there is this balancing, which was only really right for me in a few moments. I like hard games, have played through all the titles from From Software several times since Demon's Souls, and I've also enjoyed defeating titles from other manufacturers - except Lords of the Fallen, which was a bummer. I never had the feeling that the difficulty was so strongly defined by the boss' life energy and my character level as in Nioh 2, which could be compensated by grinding a little bit, but it just doesn't feel quite right. Friends of the genre and the scenario should definitely have a look into the game, because despite all criticism I liked the game. But it is not enough for the throne, which is still occupied by Bloodborne."
Dave  Rodriguez,2020-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Team Ninja opts for the bigger is better approach. More mechanics, weapons,story and a bunch of insane bosses make Nioh 2 an action delight."
Marc Deschamps,2020-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is the kind of action game that's clearly targeted towards a certain type of gamer. It's an incredibly difficult game, and gamers that don't have the patience or commitment to learning its various intricacies just aren't going to get as much out of the game. However, fans of the original title and gamers that enjoy that kind of difficulty level will find that they will get out of Nioh 2 what they're willing to put into it."
Ben Moore,2020-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,Nioh 2 refines what is great about the original game while also repeating a few mistakes.
Vasilis Papaspiliou,2020-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Despite its difficulty, the game never gets tedious, as it is constantly finding ways to make the player complete one mission after another."
Miguel Samson,2020-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 [encourages] you to be creative and personalize your whole gameplay experience. The only hurdle for players new to the franchise is it'ss very steep difficulty and learning curve. But if you can tough it out and get past that, this is a game you may even see yourself revisiting time and again."
Nick Petrasiti,2020-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,I loved Nioh 2 and it's definitely earned its place amongst the soulslikes.
Martin Kubeš,2020-04-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Dark Souls 2 couldn't match the original, however Nioh 2 crushes in that regard. The sequel didn't lose any of the charm of the first game and the quality bar stayed firmly in its place. If you're into soulslikes, don't hesitate even for a moment."
Jon Peltz,2020-04-03T00:00:00.000Z,Nioh 2 softens the blow of its demanding combat by giving the player myriad ways to decapitate an enemy. An absolute joy to learn how to play.
Ján Kordoš,2020-04-03T00:00:00.000Z,Daemonic warrior is back and still so tought and for players with a lot of patience.
Jake Su,2020-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Master the intricacies of Nioh 2 and immerse yourself in a world of splendid combat, satisfying challenge, and a transcendent experience like only Team Ninja can."
Jordan Hawes,2020-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is an extremely well done sequel that adds enough to an already complex combat system, but not too much to make systems redundant or cumbersome. The changes aren’t drastic, and this may lead to some feeling like it feels too similar, but the first game already had fantastic gameplay variety."
David Valero,2020-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,I do not see a single reason to miss this game that climbs a step at all levels with respect to its predecessor and that does not have any major shortcomings.
Cosmin Vasile,2020-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Although Nioh 2 may feel a bit overwhelming due to the complexity and the amount of new gameplay mechanics introduced, what you find underneath is the personification of elegance and brutality bound in a single body."
Kieran Toovey,2020-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The end result is a game that feels too familiar all the way through with fleeting moments of originality. That being said, it is still worth it for diehard Soulsborne fans and/or lovers of the original Nioh."
Jesús Díaz-Suelto Berrueco,2020-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I finished the first Nioh enchanted, loving his combat and how he used Japanese history and mythology. Nioh 2 gives you that multiplied by ten, improves the main setbacks of the previous one, and generally ends up rounding out the set to offer a long, replayable, fun, challenging but fair game, and a long etcetera. His only mistake could be to be a continuity player at his base, but he offers such an obvious improvement that in the end this happens."
Cody Peterson,2020-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,Keeps feeling fresh all the way through.
Leif Rey Bornales,2020-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,"If you’ve been looking to quench your thirst for a game that is challenging and would be fun to play with your friends this Nioh 2 is surely there to help you out. Overall, I believe that Nioh 2 has satisfied my thirst for git gud adventures and it’s definitely a game worth playing."
Bob Richardson,2020-03-29T00:00:00.000Z,An exemplar of how several complex systems can work seamlessly together.
Jordan Garcia,2020-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,A few missteps don't stop Nioh 2 from being a superb sequel to one of the stronger Soulslike games around
Dan Rizzo,2020-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,"While Team Ninja leave us wanting more from their unique Souls series, they are an inspiring reminder to all gamers everywhere of how innovative the Kyoto based, development company are, and how it will forever be associated with this franchise. Nioh 2 forges a legacy that will ultimately set a benchmark for future Souls-like titles, in hopes to eventually lead us into a new generation of vigorous, yet compelling video games."
Konrad Noga,2020-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is everything that From Software’s fans wished Sekiro to be – a Dark Souls game with a Japanese theme. Even though it has some problems and from time to time you may feel a bit tired of the repetitive missions, Nioh 2 remains both a great game and a perfect sequel."
Emil Gunnarsson,2020-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,Nioh 2 offers best in class combat but suffers from an overwhelming number of upgrade systems and a story that is utterly incoherent.
Jose Andres Cardona,2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is a very good video game. Fun, entertaining and, although it does not revolutionize and we can piss off dying so much, it brings new ways of playing and enough novelties to spend hundreds of hours testing builds to be the best samurai. It can get desperate at times, but with patience we will be powerful warriors."
Aaron Riccio,2020-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,The game is limited by the static nature of its mission-based structure and the protagonist's severe lack of motivation.
Martín Rodríguez,2020-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"With improved combat mechanics and an even higher difficulty, Ni-Oh 2 is great for fans and newcomers alike, in one of the top games of 2020."
A.J. Maciejewski,2020-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is one of the most improved sequels to a game that I've ever had the pleasure of playing. With top-notch gameplay and highly rewarding open-ended character progression systems, I simply can't wait to see how Nioh 3 is going to turn out."
Δημήτρης Σαλαμάρας,2020-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is a content-rich package, with many new features and additions. Souls fans and those who fell in love with the first game will surely enjoy this prequel, despite the few drawbacks like repeating environments and enemies."
Víctor Rosas,2020-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Brutal from start to finish, Nioh 2 turnes its outstanding combat system into a deadly dance that knows how to be cruel with defeat, but honorable with victory. It may not be far from the first game, but it was enough to refine the elements that founded the franchise to deliver one of the best titles of the closing of this generation."
Estela Villa,2020-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2 is a game that you will enjoy if you want challenges. If you have already played the first game, this second game has few playable improvements, but if you liked it, you should give it a chance to see if you are able to continue to overcome the difficulty of a game like this one."
Claudio Albero,2020-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Although starting from the excellent foundations laid by the previous chapter of the saga, Nioh 2 manages to innovate almost every aspect of it, proving to be a game of absolute excellence, able to meet the needs of every type of player. The most demanding and hardcore gamer will find his teeth, but even the user less accustomed to punitive mechanics will find his space, using certain builds and the Graves of Mercy. The soul cores and explosive counterattack are great additions to a gameplay already solid and compelling, but now it is even deeper and more varied, able to satisfy all palates. The only two flaws are the crafting and multiplayer, not developed enough, but nothing that may cloud our overall judgment."
Alleef Ashaari,2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"As extremely hard as the game can be, Nioh 2 is proof that the Soulsborne genre can still be polished, refined, and utilize unique mechanics, all of which makes it worth suffering through. Team Ninja’s latest title is definitely more accessible than Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and certainly an early contender for Game Of The Year 2020."
Will Borger,2020-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Nioh 2's incredible combat system, varied levels, diverse enemies, and insane levels of customization make it a game worth playing - provided you can get over how hard it is."
